	dcterms:description	"""1,4-Dioxane (also called dioxane) is a semi-volatile, colorless liquid with a faint sweet odor, produced in large amounts (1-10 million pounds in 1994, 1998, and 2002) in the United States.[1] For many years, it was primarily used as a stabilizer for 1,1,1-trichloroethane transport and storage, but that use is being phased out. It is also used as a solvent in the manufacture of household products such as detergents, soaps, lotions, shampoos, and cosmetics, in a variety of food manufacturing and food packaging processes, and is also used as a solvent in the manufacture of  lacquers, paints, varnishes, waxes, resins, etc. 1,4-dioxane is water soluble and readily leaches into groundwater; thus,it has a high potential for entering the environment. Dioxane has affected groundwater supplies in many areas.
1,4-Dioxane has been classified by IARC as a Group 2N carcinogen, meaning that it is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals.[2] The United States Environmental Protection Agency classifies dioxane as a probable human carcinogen.[3] The compound has an LD50 of 5170 mg/kg.[4]  
1,4-dioxane is absorbed rapidly following inhalation or oral exposure, with much less absorption occurring  through skin contact. Toxicology data for exposure to 1,4-dioxane in humans is limited to a few inhalation exposure studies; no human data is available for oral or dermal exposures. The inhalation studies show that breathing 1,4-dioxane vapor for short periods of time causes irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, and that exposure to large amounts of 1,4-dioxane may cause kidney and liver damage. Accidental exposure of workers to high concentrations (unspecified) of 1,4-dioxane (via inhalation and dermal contact) have resulted in several deaths and the symptoms associated with those deaths suggest adverse nervous system effects and kidney toxicity. Studies in humans found no conclusive evidence for a causal link between occupational exposure to dioxane and increased risk for cancer; however, only two studies were available and these were limited by small cohort size and a small number of reported cancer cases.[5,6] 
All exposure routes have been studied and described in animals. The majority of these studies have been subchronic and chronic studies of exposure to 1,4-dioxane administered in drinking water where oral exposure induced squamous cell carcinomas in the nasal turbinates and hepatocellular carcinomas in rats of both sexes, and increased the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in mice of both sexes. Liver and kidney toxicity were the primary noncancer health effects of subchronic and chronic oral exposure to 1,4-dioxane in animals. 
There are only two subchronic inhalation studies and two chronic inhalation studies in animals.  Inhalation exposure induced hepatocellular carcinomas in rats of both sexes. Liver and nasal toxicity are the primary noncancer health effects associated with inhalation exposure. 
An oral reference dose (RfD) has been established at 0.03 mg/kg-day, with an overall confidence of medium. The oral cancer slope factor (CSF) is 0.10 (mg/kg-day)-1. The inhalation reference concentration (RfC) is 0.03 mg/m3, also with an overall confidence of medium. The IUR is 5 x 10-6 (ÔÅ≠g/m3 -1.

	dcterms:description	"""This Adverse outcome Pathway (AOP) describes the linkage between inhibition of complex I (CI) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and motor deficit as in parkinsonian disorders. Binding of an inhibitor to complex I has been defined as the molecular initiating event (MIE) that triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired proteostasis, which then cause degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the nigro-striatal pathway. Neuroinflammation is triggered early in the neurodegenerative process and exacerbates it significantly. These causatively linked cellular key events result in motor deficit symptoms, typical for parkinsonian disorders, including Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD), described in this AOP as an Adverse Outcome (AO). Since the release of dopamine in the striatum by DA neurons of the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) is essential for motor control, the key events refer to these two brain structures. The weight-of-evidence supporting the relationship between the described key events is based mainly on effects observed after an exposure to the chemicals rotenone and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), i.e. two well-known inhibitors of complex I. Data from experiments with these two chemicals reveal a significant concordance in the dose-response relationships between the MIE and AO and within key events (KEs). Also essentiality of the described KEs for this AOP is strong since there is evidence from knock out animal models, engineered cells or replacement therapies that blocking, preventing or attenuating an upstream KE is mitigating the AO. Similarly, there is proved experimental support for the key event relationships (KERs) as multiple studies performed with modulating factors that attenuate (particularly with antioxidants) or augment (e.g. overexpression of viral-mutated &alpha;-synuclein) a KE up show that such interference leads to an increase of KE down or the AO. Information from in vitro and in vivo experiments is complemented by human studies in brain tissues from individuals with sporadic Parkinson&#39;s disease (Keeney et al., 2006) to support the pathways of toxicity proposed in this AOP.

	dcterms:description	"""Molting is a natural biological process in arthropods. During a molt cycle, the animals generate new exoskeletons by the epidermis and shed the old ones in order to grow. Successful molting is key to survival, development and reproduction. Over half a century research on arthropod endocrinology reveals that molting is precisely controlled by complex multi-hormone systems, with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) being the key effective hormone to mediate different biological processes that are necessary for molting. The hormonal actions of 20E are exerted through binding and modulation of the ecdysone receptors (EcR), which are nuclear transcriptional factors that regulate a wide range of physiological and behavioral changes. Based on this knowledge, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) targeting at the EcRs are developed as pesticides and anti-parasite pharmaceuticals in order to disrupt the molting cycles of &ldquo;harmful&rdquo; arthropods and protect the agriculture and aquaculture. However, environmental residues of these EDCs may also affect non-target species, such as a number of crustaceans (e.g. crabs and lobsters) with great ecological and economical values, due to highly conserved endocrine systems in arthropods. Substantial efforts are therefore needed to assess the environmental hazards and risks of EDCs on non-target species. Due to the high number (over a million described) of species in the phylum of Arthopoda, it is not feasible to perform toxicity testing for each species as well as EDC. Construction of universal models on basis of systems (eco)toxicology and phylogenetic similarities for understanding the environmental endocrine disruption (ED) effects may serve as a potential solution. The current AOP is therefore developed based on available information in the databases to identify knowledge gaps in this research field. The conceptual AOP will be further expanded using a combination of laboratory studies and advance in sillico predictions of potential EcR ligands and taxonomic appllicablity to inform environmental risk assessment as an ultimate goal.

	dcterms:description	"""This case study aims at making AOPs triggered by oral exposure to Pentachlorophenol (PCP) of liver and possible new aspect of systemic toxicity.  In this case study, Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was monitored for adult mouse liver transcriptome responses 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours after single oral administration with four dose levels, 0, 10, 30 and 100mg/kg, using Affymetrix GeneChip MOE430 2.0. The expression data were absolutized by the Percellome method and expressed as three dimensional (3D) surface graphs with axises of time, dose and copy numbers of mRNA per cell. Homemade software RSort was used for comprehensive screening of the 3D surface data followed by visual inspection to confirm the significant responses, and PercellomeExploror for cross-referencing. In the first 8 hours, approximately 100 probe sets (PSs) related to PXR/SXR and Cyp2a4 and other metabolic enzymes were induced, and Fos and Junb were suppressed. At 24 hours, about 1,200 PSs were strongly induced. Cross-referencing the Percellome database consisting of 111 chemicals on liver transcriptome revealed that about half of the PSs belonged to the metabolic pathways including Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response networks, sharing with some of the 111 chemicals. The other half was interferon signalling network genes (ISG), and was unique to PCP. Toll like receptors and other pattern recognition receptors, interferon regulatory factors and interferon alpha itself were included. On the other hand, inflammatory cytokines were not induced. In summary, functional symptoms of PCP, such as hyperthermia and profuse sweating might be mediated by the ISG rather than the hitherto documented mitochondrial uncoupling mechanism. Reports of imiquimod and RO8191 as agonists of toll-like receptor and interferon receptor might associate PCP with a seed for interferon mimetic drugs (cf. Figure below).
This case study will also serve as an example of how the Percellome Project Database and Percellome Analytical Tools can be effectively applied to the AOP development. Further studies including in silico data mining will expand the AOP to cover the chronic liver toxicity induced by PCP.

	dcterms:description	"""The present AOP describes antagonistic chemical binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &alpha; (PPAR&alpha;) resulting in preferential binding a co-repressor to the overall PPAR&alpha; signaling complex causing a chain of events that includes: antagonism of PPAR&alpha; nuclear signaling, decreased transcriptional expression of PPAR&alpha;-regulated genes that support energy metabolism, and inhibited metabolic energy production culminating with starvation-like weight loss. The AOP is likely to be synergized during fasting, starvation or malnutrition events.&nbsp; The MIE for this AOP involves antagonistic PPAR&alpha; binding. The antagonist-binding to the PPAR&alpha; regulatory complex causes the KE1, stabilization of co-repressor (SMRT or N-CoR) to PPARalpha ligand binding domain suppressing PPAR&alpha; nuclear signaling (Nagy et al 1999, Xu et al 2002). PPAR&alpha; is a transcriptional regulator for a variety of genes that facilitate systemic energy homeostasis (Kersten 2014, Evans et al 2004, Desvergne and Wahli 1999). As a result of the MIE and then KE1, the KE2 occurs where PPARalpha transactivation is inhibited for genes involved in the next 2 key events of the AOP: (KE3) decreased fatty acid beta oxidation (Desvergne and Wahili 1999, Kersten 2014, Dreyer et al 1992, Lazarow 1978, Brandt et al 1998; Mascaro et al 1998, Aoyama et al 1998, Gulick et al 1994, Sanderson et al 2008) and (KE4) decreased ketogenesis (Cahil 2006, Kersten et al 2014, Sengupta et al 2010, Desvergne and Wahli 1999). The KE3 results in decreased catabolism of very long chain fatty acids in peroxisomes and reduced catabolism of long, medium and short chain fatty acids in mitochondria reducing acetyl-CoA availability for use in oxidative phosphorylation-based ATP production (Evans et al 2004).&nbsp; KE2 (and also potentially KE3) can drive KE4 resulting in decreased potential to repackage energy substrates as ketone bodies to support systemic energy demands during periods where the systemic energy budget is negative (Badman et al 2007, Potthoff 2009; Muoio et al 2002). The KE5, no change or a decrease in circulating ketone bodies becomes critical during cellular energy deficit conditions, a state where ketogenesis is typically induced to increase circulating ketone bodies providing metabolic fuel to sustain energy homeostasis (Cahill 2006). Physiological studies of the progression of human starvation have demonstrated the critical importance of ketogenesis, especially production of &beta;-hydroxybutyrate, for meeting systemic energy demands by supplementing glucose to sustain the energy requirements of the brain (Cahill 2006, Owen et al 2005). PPAR&alpha; knock can inhibit ketogenesis from fatty acid substrates in fasted mice reducing &beta;-hydroxybutyrate production causing hypoketonemia (Badman et al 2007, Le May et al 2000, Muoio et al 2002).&nbsp; Sustained negative energy budgets lead to KE6, an increase in muscle protein catabolism, with glutamine and alanine recycled for gluconeogenesis (Felig et al 1970A, Kashiwaya et al 1994). &nbsp;If ketogenesis from fatty acid substrates fails to meet cellular energy needs, gluconeogenesis from alternative substrates becomes necessary including (KE 6) muscle protein catabolism in situ supporting local muscle function and releasing glutamine (Marliss et al 1971) and alanine (Felig et al 1970A) for gluconeogenesis in kidney and liver to sustain systemic energy needs (Goodman et al 1966, Kashiwaya et al 1994, Cahill 2006).&nbsp; Finally, the AO of body-weight loss occurs, which within the context of dynamic energy budget theory, decreases energy allocations to organismal maturation and reproduction (Nisbet et al 2000) and has been demonstrated to negatively affect ecological fitness (Martin et al 1987).

	dcterms:description	"""This AOP links activation of the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor&gamma; (PPAR&gamma;) to reproductive toxicity in adult female. The development of this AOP relies on evidence collected from rodent models and incorporates human mechanistic and epidemiological data. The PPAR&gamma; is a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor family, which also includes the steroid and thyroid hormone receptors. Interest in PPAR&gamma; action as a mechanistic basis for effects on the reproductive system arises from the demonstrated relationships between activation of this receptor and impairment of the steroidogenesis leading to reproductive toxicity in rodents. PPARs play important roles in the metabolic regulation of lipids, of which cholesterol, in particular being a precursor of steroid hormones, makes the link between lipid metabolism to effects on reproduction. The key events in the pathway comprise the activation of PPAR&gamma;, followed by the disruption of the hormonal balance which leads to irregularities of the ovarian cycle that may further be cause of impaired fertility. The PPAR&gamma;-initiated AOP to rodent female reproductive toxicity is a first step for structuring current knowledge about a mode of action which is neither ER-mediated nor via direct aromatase inhibition. In the current form the pathway lays a strong basis for linking an endocrine mode of action with an apical endpoint, prerequisite requirement for the identification of endocrine disrupting chemicals. This AOP is complemented with a structured data collection which will serve as the basis for further quantitative development of the pathway.

Developmental exposure of rats to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) results in a low-frequency hearing loss in adult offspring (Goldey et al., 1995a; Herr et al., 1996; 2001; Crofton and Rice, 1999; Laskey et al., 2002). A body of work now supports the hypothesis that this ototoxicity results from PCB-induced hypothyroxinemia during a critical period of auditory development. Evidence for this hypothesis includes: a correlation between the severity of functional auditory impairment and the degree of thyroid hormone depletion (Goldey et al., 1995a; 1995b; Goldey and Crofton, 1998; Crofton, 2004), a cross-fostering study demonstrating that the critical exposure period is postnatal (Crofton et al., 2000a), and amelioration of the hearing loss following postnatal thyroxine replacement (Goldey and Crofton, 1998). Below an adverse outcome pathway is described for chemicals that activate xenobiotic nuclear receptors, including AhR, CAR, and PXR, leading to thyroid hormone disruption during cochlear development and resulting in permanent auditory loss.

	dcterms:description	"""This AOP begins with a molecular initiating event (MIE) where a chemicla&nbsp;binds to the picrotoxin binding site at or near the central pore of the ionotropic GABA receptor complex causing blockage of the ion channel. As a result, the first key event (KE)&nbsp;is a decrease in inward chloride conductance through the ligand-gated ion channel. This leads to the second KE, a reduction in postsynaptic inhibition, reflected as reduced frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) or abolishment of GABA-induced firing action in GABAergic neuronal membranes. Consequently, the resistance of excitatory neurons to fire is decreased, resulting in the generation of a large excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), i.e., the third KE.&nbsp;The large EPSP is reflected as a&nbsp;spike (rise) of intracellular Ca2+ observed in the affected region, where a large group of excitatory neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. Such a giant Ca2+-mediated excitatory firing (depolarization) causes voltage-gated Na+ to open, which results in action potentials. The depolarization is followed by a period of hyper-polarization mediated by Ca2+-dependent K+ channels or GABA-activated Cl&minus; influx. During seizure development, the post-depolarlization hyperpolarization becomes smaller, gradually disappears, and is replaced by a depolarization. This characteristic depolarization-shrinking hyperpolarization sequence&nbsp;of events represents the fourth KE known as &ldquo;paroxysmal depolarizing shift&rdquo; (PDS), which forms a &ldquo;seizure focus&rdquo;. A PDS is, essentially, an indication of epilepsy at the cellular level, which serves as the foci to initiate the adverse outcome at the organismal level of epileptic seizure. The severity of symptoms is often dose- and duration- dependent, while the toxicological symptoms are associated with the type and location of affected iGABARs. Mortality can occur if the individual sustains a prolonged or pronounced convulsion or seizure. Neurotoxicity, of which seizures&nbsp;are&nbsp;an end point, is a regulated outcome for chemicals. This AOP allows for screening chemicals for the potential to cause neurotoxicity through the use of in vitro assays that demonstrate binding to the picrotoxin site, electrophysiological assays demonstrating depolarization of neuronal membranes, or electroencephalography that records electrical activity of the adult brain.

	dcterms:description	"""This case study aims at making AOPs triggered by oral exposure to Pentachlorophenol (PCP) of liver and possible new aspect of systemic toxicity.  In this case study, Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was monitored for adult mouse liver transcriptome responses 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours after single oral administration with four dose levels, 0, 10, 30 and 100mg/kg, using Affymetrix GeneChip MOE430 2.0. The expression data were absolutized by the Percellome method and expressed as three dimensional (3D) surface graphs with axises of time, dose and copy numbers of mRNA per cell. Homemade software RSort was used for comprehensive screening of the 3D surface data followed by visual inspection to confirm the significant responses, and PercellomeExploror for cross-referencing. In the first 8 hours, approximately 100 probe sets (PSs) related to PXR/SXR and Cyp2a4 and other metabolic enzymes were induced, and Fos and Junb were suppressed. At 24 hours, about 1,200 PSs were strongly induced. Cross-referencing the Percellome database consisting of 111 chemicals on liver transcriptome revealed that about half of the PSs belonged to the metabolic pathways including Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response networks, sharing with some of the 111 chemicals. The other half was interferon signalling network genes (ISG), and was unique to PCP. Toll like receptors and other pattern recognition receptors, interferon regulatory factors and interferon alpha itself were included. On the other hand, inflammatory cytokines were not induced. In summary, functional symptoms of PCP, such as hyperthermia and profuse sweating might be mediated by the ISG rather than the hitherto documented mitochondrial uncoupling mechanism. Reports of imiquimod and RO8191 as agonists of toll-like receptor and interferon receptor might associate PCP with a seed for interferon mimetic drugs (cf. Figure below).
This case study will also serve as an example of how the Percellome Project Database and Percellome Analytical Tools can be effectively applied to the AOP development. Further studies including in silico data mining will expand the AOP to cover the chronic liver toxicity induced by PCP.

	dcterms:description	"""This AOP is an extension of AOP 13 linking NMDAR chronic inhibition during brain development to impairment of learning and memory. It links chronic NMDA receptors inhibition during brain development to Adverse Outcomes, i.e. neurodegeneration in hippocampus and cortex with amyloid plaque deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation and impairment of learning and memory, which are considered as hallmark of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. It introduces another KE, Neuroinflammation, which is involved in several neurodegenerative diseases. With Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration, this AOP connects to AOP 48, where in adult brain, &laquo;&nbsp;neuroinflammation&nbsp;&raquo; leads to &laquo;&nbsp;Neurodegeneration&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;; &laquo;&nbsp;Neurodegeneration&nbsp;&raquo; leads to &laquo;&nbsp;Decreased neuronal network function&nbsp;&raquo;, which finally leads to &laquo;&nbsp;Impairement of learning and memory&nbsp;&raquo;. Both neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits are observed in Alzheimer&rsquo;s pathology. But as neurodegenerative diseases are complex and multifactorial, the authors proposed two Adverse outcomes: one at the organism level &laquo;&nbsp;Impairment of learning and memory&raquo;, and one at the organ level, &laquo;&nbsp;neurodegeneration&nbsp;&raquo;. Both are regulatory endpoints. This AOP integrates in the network of AOPs relative to neurotoxicity testing.

This AOP is based on the hypothesis of Landrigan and coworkers (2005) proposing an early origin of neurodegenerative diseases in later life. The chemical initiator known to block NMDARs and used in this AOP for the empirical support is lead (Pb), which is a well-known developmental neurotoxicant. In epidemiological studies of adults, cumulative lifetime lead exposure has been associated with accelerated decline in cognition (Bakulski et al., 2012), suggesting that long term exposure to lead during brain development or occupational exposure in adulthood increases the risk to develop a neurodegenerative disease of Alzheimer&#39;s type. The long latency period between exposure and late-onset of neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits gives a very broad life-stage applicability, where developmental exposure has consequences in the aging brain. Such a long temporal delay between exposure and adverse outcome is a real difficulty and challenge for neurotoxicity testing. As the Key Event &laquo;&nbsp;Neuroinflammation&nbsp;&raquo; appears to play a crucial role in the neurodegenerative process, the authors propose to include the measurement of this apical KE in the battery of regulation-required neurotoxicity testing.

	dcterms:description	"""It is well documented and accepted that learning and memory processes rely on physiological functioning of the glutamate receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDAR). Both animal and human studies investigating NMDA itself, experiments with NMDAR antagonists and mutant mice lacking NMDAR subunits strongly support this statement (Rezvani, 2006). Activation of NMDARs results in long-term potentiation (LTP), which is related to increased synaptic strength, plasticity and memory formation in the hippocampus (Johnston et al., 2009). LTP induced by activation of NMDA receptors has been found to be elevated in the developing rodent brain compared to the mature brain, partially due to &#39;developmental switch&#39; of the NMDAR 2A and 2B subunits (Johnston et al., 2009). Activation of the NMDAR also enhances brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release, which promotes neuronal survival, differentiation and synaptogenesis (Tyler et al., 2002; Johnston et al., 2009). Consequently, the blockage of NMDAR by chemical substances during synaptogenesis disrupts neuronal network formation resulting in the impairment of learning and memory processes (Toscano and Guilarte, 2005). This AOP is relevant to developmental neurotoxicity (DNT). The molecular initiating event (MIE) is described as the chronic binding of antagonist to NMDAR in neurons during synaptogenesis (development) in hippocampus (one of the critical brain structures for learning and memory formation). One of the chemicals that blocks NMDAR after chronic exposure is lead (Pb2+), a well-known developmental neurotoxicant.

	dcterms:description	"""Germ cell/heritable mutations are important regulatory endpoints for international agencies interested in protecting the health of future generations. However, germ cell mutation analysis has been hampered by a lack of efficient tools. With the publication of the OECD test guideline TG488 (rodent transgene mutation assay) and new technologies (including next generation sequencing) this field is experiencing renewed focus. Indeed, regulatory approaches to assess germ cell mutagenicity were the focus of an IWGT workshop (Yauk et al., 2013). Of particular concern is the inability to address this endpoint through high-throughput screening assays (because spermatogenesis cannot be carried out in culture), and mutagenesis is an important gap in existing high-throughput tests. The motivation for developing this AOP was to provide context for new assays in this field, identify research gaps and facilitate the development of new methods.

In this AOP, a compound capable of alkylating DNA is delivered to the testes causing germ cell mutations and subsequent mutations in the offspring of the exposed parents. The AOP requires uptake of the parent compound or metabolite in spermatogonia and interaction with DNA in those cells. DNA alkylation in male pre-meiotic germ cells is the molecular initiating event. A variety of different DNA adducts are formed that are subject to DNA repair; however, at high doses the repair machinery becomes saturated or overwhelmed. The fate of remaining adducts includes: (1) attempted DNA repair by alternative DNA repair machinery, or (2) no repair. Key event (KE) 1 is insufficient or incorrect DNA repair. Lack of repair can lead to replication of adducted DNA and ensuing mutations in male pre-meiotic germ cells (KE2). Mutations that do not impair spermatogenic processes will persist in these cells and eventually be present in the mature sperm. Thus, the mutations can be transmitted to the offspring (adverse outcome &ndash; inherited mutations). It is well documented that mice and other animals exposed to alkylating agents develop mutations in male pre-meiotic germ cells that are then found in sperm, resulting in the transmission of mutations to their offspring. There is a significant amount of empirical evidence supporting the AOP and the overall weight of evidence is strong. Although there are some gaps surrounding some mechanistic aspects of this AOP, the overarching AOP is widely accepted and applies broadly to any species that produces sperm.

	dcterms:description	"""The contents of this AOP page represent a network of two separate AOPs linking the MIE of acetylcholinesterase inhibition to the AO of acute mortality. Both AOPs include the KE of acetylcholine accumulation at the synapses. The downstream consequences of this KE are dependent on the tissue context and the specific type(s) of acetylcholine receptors present in those tissues. For example, one of the AOPs focuses on the effect of excess acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junctions of skeletal muscle which is mediated through impacts on nicotinic (N2, Nm) acteylcholine receptor. The other AOP considers impacts of acetycholine at the synapses in cardiac tissue, where muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M3) are known to be involved in regulation of heart rate. While these two AOPs are represented on the basis of their most plausible linkages to acute mortality, other known symptoms of acetylcholinesterase inhibition mediated through actions on other receptors and tissues are also known and may also play a role (see Russom et al. 2014). Overall, there is strong evidence supporting the linkage of acetylcholinesterase inhibition and acetylcholine accumulation with acute mortality, however, the evidence supporting a direct role of the intermediate organ level key events is less clear. This network of AOPs as a whole, including the indirect KERs depicted, supports the potential utility of in vitro or short-term in vivo measures of acetylcholinesterase inhibition for identifying chemicals with potential to cause systemic neurotoxicity at sub-narcotic concentrations. At present, quantitative understanding is not sufficiently complete to accurately predict apical outcomes or potency from in vitro measurements alone, and well known chemical initiators of these AOPs are known to require metabolic activation, suggesting chemical-specific ADME and toxicokinetic considerations will be strong determinant of quantitative outcomes along these AOPs.

To date, review of the available literature regarding the role of intermediate key events is incomplete. It is likely that extant literature could be used to further evaluate those relationships.

	dcterms:description	"""This Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) describes the linkage between binding to sulfhydryl(SH)-/seleno-proteins and impairment of learning and memory, a deficit observed in autism spectrum disorders. Binding to SH-/ seleno-proteins has been defined as the Molecular Initiating Event (MIE). As the binding to the SH-/seleno-groups directly interferes with the function of the SH-/seleno-containing proteins, which are mainly located in mitochondria or are involved in the protection against oxidative stress, the MIE directly leads to the Key Event (KE), namely oxidative stress. In turn, oxidative stress, due either to increased ROS production or decreased anti-oxidant defenses leads to either cell injury/death or to glutamate dyshomeostasis. Glutamate dyshomeostasis, in turn, leads to cell injury/death via excitotoxicity due to overactivation of NMDA receptors, as described in AOP 48. Cell injury/death will affect the network formation and function, culminating in functional deficits such as impairment in learning and memory, defined as the Adverse Outcome (AO). Neuroinflammation is triggered secondary to cell injury/death and will exacerbate the neurotoxic pathway. According to the new AOP rules, neuroinflammation is defined by the two hub KEs: Tissue resident cell activation and increased pro-inflammatory mediators, which are common to all inflammatory processes across all tissues and permit connection with all AOPs where inflammation is an inherent mechanism. As an intermediary application of these new rules, the Key Events Relationships (KERs) linking these two hub KEs with cell injury/death are represented, but the description is found under the KERs linking neuroinflammation to cell injury/death. Two reasons account for it: (i) it allows to link this AOP with the other AOPs for neurotoxicity where neuroinflammation&nbsp; is included as a KE; and (ii) there is not sufficient literature for the empirical support allowing to treat the two KEs separately. The weight-of-evidence supporting the relationships between the described KEs is based mainly on effects observed after exposure to mercury (methylmercury, mercury chloride, thiomersal, mercury metal vapor), and some scarce studies on the effects of acrylamide and acrolein. Essentiality of the KEs for this AOP is moderate to strong, since blocking, preventing or attenuating an upstream KE is mitigating the downstream KE. The domain of applicability of this AOP is mainly defined for brain development, but a similar sequence of KEs can occur in adult brain leading to the same AO, also associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

The development of this AOP relies on evidence collected from rodent models and incorporates human mechanistic and epidemiological data. The PPAR&alpha; is a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor family, which also includes the steroid and thyroid hormone receptors. The hypothesis that PPAR&alpha; action is the mechanistic basis for effects on the reproductive system arises from limited experimental data indicating relationships between activation of this receptor and impairment of steroidogenesis leading to reproductive toxicity. PPARs play important roles in the metabolic regulation of lipids, of which cholesterol, in particular, being a precursor of steroid hormones, makes the link between lipid metabolism to effects on reproduction. The key events in the pathway comprise the activation of PPAR&alpha;, followed by the disruption cholesterol transport in mitochondria, impairment of hormonal balance which leads to malformation of the reproductive tract in males which may lead to impaired fertility. The PPAR&alpha;-initiated AOP to rodent male developmental toxicity is a first step for structuring current knowledge about a mode of action which is neither AR-mediated nor via direct steroidogenesis enzymes inhibition. In the current form the pathway lays a strong basis for linking an endocrine mode of action with an apical endpoint, a prerequisite requirement for the identification of endocrine disrupting chemicals. This AOP is complemented with a structured data collection which will serve as the basis for further quantitative development of the pathway.

	dcterms:description	"""This adverse outcome pathway details the linkage between the antagonism of the androgen receptor (AR) leading to adverse effects in the male foetus.  For a more detailed explanation of this pathway, with supporting references, please refer to the project report to the OECD [1].
The AR is involved in the mediation of various cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in many tissues.  The two main events regulated by AR mediated gene expression are urogenital tract differentiation during gestation and sexual changes during puberty.  The AR can be activated by the binding of the endogenous androgens testosterone and its metabolite 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which can activate gene expression at the transcription level.  In mammals, virilisation of the external genitalia is driven by DHT while the differentiation of the Wolffian duct is driven by testosterone.
Chemicals which bind to the AR may cause disruption by agonism, antagonism or by both mechanisms.  Agonists will mimic the action of the endogenous androgens, whilst antagonists will block the receptor and prevent activation.
Androgen receptor antagonists divide into steroid-like and non-steroidal compounds.  Several classes or chemical categories are indicated by the data [2][3].  These include the steroidal class (cyproterone acetate), the flutamide/ ‚Äúaryl amide‚Äù class which includes bicalutamide, linuron and hydantoin analogs (such as nilutamide, vinclozin), the quinoline analog class, and the phthalimide derivatives.  The best characterised class are synthetic anilides for which the model compound is flutamide.

Flutamide exhibits potent anti-androgenic activity and in animals shows dose dependent decreases in the weight of accessory sex organs at doses of 1mg/kg and above.  In utero exposure to flutamide in rats has been shown to cause feminisation of external genitalia, nipple retention and alteration of androgen-dependent testicular descent in male foetuses.  A number of flutamide derivatives with in vitro binding data have demonstrated in vivo activity [4][5][6][7].  
In vitro the relative binding affinity (RBA) to the AR can be measured using assays which compare the competitive binding versus a control compound such as DHT or a synthetic androgen (metribolone (R1881) or mibolerone).  Although this assay can measure binding it cannot distinguish between agonists and antagonists [8][9]. Transcriptional activation in cells transfected with human AR can be used to identify agonism or antagonism with respect to that induced by a known concentration of DHT [10]. Short term in vivo studies may use the Hershberger assay or acute studies involving castrated rat models [11].

	dcterms:description	"""This adverse outcome pathway details the linkage between activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and early life stage mortality in oviparous vertebrates.&nbsp;This AOP can be initiated by a range of planar aromatic hydrocarbons, but is best known as the target of dioxin-like compounds (DLCs). These planar compounds are able to bind to the AhR causing&nbsp;heterodimerization with the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT) and interaction with dioxin-responsive elements on the DNA causing an up-regulation in dioxin responsive genes. Hundreds to thousands of genes are regulated, either directly or indirectly, by the AhR. One dioxin-responsive gene is cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) which has roles in development of the cardiovascular system. Up-regulation in expression of COX-2 causes alteration in cardiovascular development and function which results in reduced heart pumping efficiency, reduced blood flow, and eventual cardiac collapse and death. Comparable apical manifestations of activation of the AhR have been recorded across freshwater and marine teleost and non-teleost fishes, as well as birds. Therefore, this AOP might be broadly applicable across oviparous vertebrate taxa. Despite conservation in&nbsp;the AOP across taxa, great differences in sensitivity to perturbation exist both among and within taxonomic groups. Therefore, this AOP has utility in support of application toward the mechanistic understanding of adverse effects of chemicals that act as agonists of the AhR, particularly with regard to cross-chemical, cross-species, and cross-taxa extrapolation.&nbsp;

In general, biological plausibility of this AOP is strong based&nbsp;heavily on evidence collected from zebrafish (Danio rerio) through mechanistic investigations by use of targeted knockdown of AhR, ARNT, or COX-2 and through use of selective agonists and antagonists of COX-2. However, uncertainties exist regarding the interaction of multiple potential targets of AhR activation, including CYP1A, Sox9b, and HIF1a/VEGF. Quantitative understanding is largely limited to the indirect KER between&nbsp;AhR activation and early life stage mortality.

Since activation of the AhR causes pleotropic responses, it is a challenge to elucidate the precise series of key events which link activation of the AhR to early life stage mortality. Because of this uncertainty, other possible AOPs (ex. AOP 150) have also been proposed and likely occur simultaneously with COX-2 to cause altered cardiovascular development and function leading to early life stage mortality.

	dcterms:description	"""Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) have been recently introduced in human risk assessment as pragmatic tools with multiple applications. As such, AOPs intend to provide a clear-cut mechanistic representation of pertinent toxicological effects. AOPs are typically composed of a molecular initiating event, a series of intermediate steps and key events, and an adverse outcome. In the current study, an AOP framework is proposed for cholestasis triggered by drug-mediated inhibition of the bile salt export pump transporter protein. For this purpose, an in-depth survey of relevant scientific literature was carried out in order to identify intermediate steps and key events. The latter include bile accumulation, the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation, and the activation of specific nuclear receptors. Collectively, these mechanisms drive both a deteriorative cellular response, which underlies directly caused cholestatic injury, and an adaptive cellular response, which is aimed at counteracting cholestatic insults. AOP development was performed according to OECD guidance, including critical consideration of the Bradford Hill criteria for weight of evidence assessment and the OECD key questions for evaluating AOP confidence. The postulated AOP is expected to serve as the basis for the development of new in vitro tests and the characterization of novel biomarkers of drug-induced cholestasis.

	dcterms:description	"""This AOP describes the linkages between agonism of the estrogen receptor (ER) and population relevant impacts on reproductive function in a range of oviparous vertebrates including amphibia, birds and fish.  The information in this AOP for ER agonism does not apply to mammalian species and also not to invertebrates.  


Amphibians are sensitive to ER agonists during the transformation from larval tadpole to juvenile frog as these include critical periods of metamorphic development and sex differentiation that may be particularly sensitive to endocrine disruption.  Larvae exposed to ER agonists during mid-metamorphosis show developmental effects, a subsequent strong female-biased sex ratio which suggests that transient early life-stage exposure to ER agonists can produce effects on the reproductive organs that persist into the beginning of adult life-stages.  Birds are also known to be vulnerable to ER agonists causing disruption of estrogen-regulated functions such as sexual differentiation and sexual behaviour.  Model species such as the Japanese quail have been widely used as a model for studying various long-term effects after embryonic exposure to ER agonists.  In terms of teleost fish, exposure to ER agonists leads to a suite of adverse outcomes depending upon whether exposures occur during or beyond the larval, juvenile and adult life-stages.  For example,  aquatic exposure to potent ER agonists during the larval and juvenile life-stages may leads to gonadal and renal pathology and skewed-sex ratios in adult fish (potentially 100% females).  Larval, juvenile and adult male fish exposed to the same ER agonists display abnormal plasma or whole body levels of vitellogenin (VTG).  Cumulative fecundity in adult populations is also adversely affected by ER agonists and this is an important endpoint in the OECD Test Guideline 229 Fish Short Term Reproduction Assay.  In summary, this AOP has utility in supporting the application of test methods for detecting ER agonists, or in silico predictions of the ability of chemicals to act as ER agonists and cause impaired sexual development and reproductive dysfunction.

	dcterms:description	"""Studies have shown that aniline, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) are converted to the reactive metabolite and form free radicals leading to oxidization of heme Iron(II) in hemoglobin to Iron(III), a molecular initiating event.    Damage then occurs to red blood cells (RBCs) and methemoglobinemia ensues which is characterized by reduced RBCs, hemoglobin concentration, and Heinz body formation (Ellis et al. 1985, Lee et al. 1976, 1978, Hazleton Laboratories 1977, 1982, Kozuka et al. 1978, 1979, Bolt et al. 2006). The adverse outcome due to such hematological effects is cyanosis with possible death if methemoglobin levels become severe.    Hemoglobin adducts are also formed by these chemicals (Sabbioni et al. 2006). Sinusoidal congestion was noted in animals who were exposed to 2,4-DNT or 2,6-DNT (Deng et al. 2011) while hemosiderosis was reported in another study involving DNT (Lee et al. 1978) and in aniline studies. A compensatory response to possible anemic effects has been observed in animals including increased peripheral reticulocytes (Deng et al. 2011) and induction of genes associated with heme biosynthesis (CPOX and UROS) (Rawat et al. 2010). Oxidative stress is also induced upon this interaction with the RBC which may lead to DNA damage and cell death to not only the RBC but other cells such as hepatocytes (Deng et al. 2011). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6pd) was found to be significantly down-regulated in animals treated with 2,4-DNT for 14 d which leads to decreased levels of NADPH, a coenzyme used to properly maintain glutathione levels and therefore protect cells, especially RBC, from oxidative damage (Wilbanks, et al., unpublished observations). In response to increased oxidative stress, protective mechanisms such as the Nrf2 mediated oxidative stress response may be induced (Deng et al. 2011). While this AOP specifically shows effects of 2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT, the principal adverse pathways of oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) leading to methemoglobinemia and its downsteam effects and oxidative stress formation leading to its downstream effects are shared with the more well characterized structurally similar compound group of N-hydroxyl anilines.

An increased incidence of liver tumors was seen in male and female Tif:MAGf mice when fed in the diet for 18 months at concentrations up to 2500 ppm. It is a mouse liver specific carcinogen and does not induce tumors at any other site in the mouse. There were no increases in cancer incidences either in the liver, or at any other site, in rats fed on diets containing up to 3000 ppm thiamethoxam for two years. Thiamethoxam was not genotoxic when evaluated in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays. 
Thiamethoxam is metabolize to two key metabolites, CGA 322704  and CGA 330050.  These metabolites can be further metabolize to CGA 265307. Basic toxicity studies on these metabolites give clues to the critical events involved in its mode of action resulting in hepatacarcinogenesis.  These metabolites were given at doses to mimic systemic exposure that would result following a tumorigenic dose of Thiamethoxam.  When administered directly in the rodent bioassay (rats and mice), the CGA 322704 and CGA 265307 metabolites did not result in any tumors or any other effect in the liver including altered serum cholesterol, liver toxicity, apoptosis, or increased cell proliferation. However, Metabolite CGA 265307 is very structurally similar with substrates and inhibitors of the nitric oxide synthases.  Direct exposure to metabolite CGA 330050 did not result in tumors but did result in the same liver toxicity effects as for thiamethoxam.  It is proposed that the metabolites CGA 330050 and CGA 265307 are involved in thiamethoxam‚Äôs hepatocarcinogensis.

	dcterms:description	"""Liver steatosis (fatty liver) is considered as one of the first manifestations of possible hepatotoxicity, however it is not regarded as an adverse effect per se and usually can be reversible. The importance of steatosis is highlighted from the fact that it is a prerequisite for the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a clinicopathological condition that comprises a wide spectrum of liver damage, ranging from steatosis alone to steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. 
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents only a stage in the spectrum of NAFLD and is defined pathologically by the presence of steatosis together with necro-inflammatory activity. The clinical implications of NAFLD are derived mostly from its potential to progress to end-stage liver disease, whereas simple uncomplicated steatosis follows a relatively benign course in most patients. 
Steatosis is the output of the disturbance on the homeostasis of hepatic lipids which depends on the dynamic balance of several pathways including fatty acid (FA) uptake, de novo FA synthesis, Œ≤-oxidation, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion. It is characterized by the accumulation of lipid droplets (mainly triglycerides) in the hepatocytes.
This AOP describes the linkage between hepatic steatosis triggered by nuclear receptors activation (PPAR gamma and LXR) through modulation of genes responsible for lipid homeostasis [the carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), the sterol response element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c),  the free fatty acid uptake transporter FAT/CD36, the fatty acid synthase (FAS),  the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)] which subsequently leasds to in rease of de novo fatty acids/triglycerides synthesis and fat influx from the peripheral tissues to liver. The accumulation of lipid in the hepatocytes can cause cytoplasm displacement, nucleus distortion, mitochondrial toxicity and eventually necrosis and/or apoptosis. The progression of this condition can lead to tissue inflammation (steatohepatitis) and fibrosis with the involvement of other cells of the hepatic tissue like the Kupffer (inflammation) and the stellate (fibrosis) cells.
This purely qualitative AOP description is plausible, the scientific data supporting the AOP are logic, coherent and consistent and there is temporal agreement between the individual KEs. Quantitative data on dose-response-relationships and temporal sequences between key events are still lacking; the provision of quantitative data will strengthen the weight of evidence and make the AOP applicable for chemical risk assessment purposes.

	dcterms:description	"""Several therapeutic agents and industrial chemicals induce liver tumors in rats and mice through the activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa). The molecular and cellular events by which PPARa activators induce rodent hepatocarcinogenesis have been extensively studied and elucidated. The weight of evidence relevant to the hypothesized AOP for PPARa activator-induced rodent hepatocarcinogenesis is summarized here. Chemical-specific and mechanistic data support concordance of temporal and dose&ndash;response relationships for the key events associated with many PPARa activators including a phthalate ester plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and the drug gemfibrozil. The key events (KE) identified are KE1&ndash;PPARa activation, KE2&ndash;alteration in cell growth pathways, KE3&ndash;perturbation of cell growth and survival including increases in cell proliferation and effects on apoptosis, KE4&ndash;selective clonal expansion of preneoplastic foci cells, which lead to the Adverse Outcome&ndash;increases in hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. A number of molecular events were identified which were initially evaluated as possible key events. However, the data were not convincing for these to be key events in the MOA. Rather, although not causal these modulating factors were considered to have the potential to alter the ability of PPARa activators to increase liver cancer. These modulating events include increases in oxidative stress, activation of NF-kB, and inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication. While biologically plausible in humans, the hypothesized key events in the rodent MOA, for PPARa activators, are unlikely to induce liver tumors in humans because of biological differences in responses. This conclusion is based on minimal or no effects observed on growth pathways, hepatocellular proliferation and liver tumors in humans and/or species (including hamsters, guinea pigs and cynomolgous monkeys) that are more appropriate human surrogates than mice and rats at overlapping dose levels.

	dcterms:description	"""Hepatotoxicity in general is of special interest for human health risk assessment. Liver fibrosis in particular is an important human health issue associated with chemical exposure and predictive assays are lacking; it is a typical result of chronic or repeated-dose toxic injury and one of the considered endpoints for regulatory purposes. It is a long-term process in which inflammation, tissue destruction, and repair occur simultaneously, together with sustained production of growth factors and fibrogenic cytokines due to a complex interplay between various hepatic cell types, various receptors and signalling pathways which lead to an imbalance between the deposition and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and a change of ECM composition. Due to this complex situation an adequate cell model is not available and an in vitro evaluation of fibrogenic potential is therefore not feasible. A sufficiently detailed description of the AOP to liver fibrosis might support chemical risk assessment by indicating early (upstream) markers for downstream events and facilitate a testing strategy without the need for a sophisticated cell model. This systematic and coherent display of currently available mechanistic-toxicological information can serve as a knowledge-based repository for identification/selection/development of in vitro methods suitable for measuring key events (KEs) and their relationships along the AOP and to facilitate the use of alternative data for regulatory purposes. Identified uncertainties and knowledge gaps can direct future research by priority setting and targeted testing. The KE descriptions can be used for hazard identification and read-across to assess the toxic potential of an untested substance.

This AOP describes the linkage between hepatic injury caused by protein alkylation and the formation of liver fibrosis. The molecular initiating event (MIE) is protein alkylation, leading to structural and functional cell injury and further to cell death, the first KE. Apoptotic hepatocytes undergo genomic DNA fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies. Upon engulfment of apoptotic bodies Kupffer cells (KCs) are activated, the next KE along the pathway. Activated KCs are the main source of TGF-&beta;1, the most potent profibrogenic cytokine. TGF-&beta;1 expression therefore is considered a KE that causes the next KE, hepatic stellate cell (HSCs) activation, meaning the transdifferentiation from a quiescent vitamin A&ndash;storing cell to a proliferative and contractile myofibroblast, the central effector in hepatic fibrosis. Activated HSCs cause progressive collagen accumulation, which together with changes in ECM composition signifies the KE on tissue level. The excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins progressively affects the whole organ and alters its normal functioning, which corresponds to liver fibrosis, the adverse outcome (AO).

There are two further events that play an important role in driving fibrogenesis, namely oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Both are on-going processes being present throughout the pathway and interconnected with most of the KEs. Hence, they are not classified as KEs themselves and described in the individual KE and key event relationship (KER) descriptions. The inflammatory response plays an important role in driving fibrogenesis, since persistent inflammation precedes fibrosis. Inflammatory signalling stems from injured hepatocytes, activated KCs and HSCs. Inflammatory and fibrogenic cells stimulate each other in amplifying fibrosis. Chemokines and their receptors provoke further fibrogenesis, as well as interacting with inflammatory cells to modify the immune response during injury. Oxidative stress, as well, plays a crucial role in liver fibrogenesis by inducing hepatocyte apoptosis, activation of KCs and HSCs and fuelling inflammation. ROS contributing to oxidative stress are generated by hepatocytes, KCs, HSCs and inflammatory cells.

This purely qualitative AOP description is plausible, the scientific data supporting the AOP are logic, coherent and consistent and there is temporal agreement between the individual KEs. Quantitative data on dose-response-relationships and temporal sequences between KEs are still lacking; the provision of quantitative data will further strengthen the weight of evidence and make the AOP applicable for a wide range of purposes.

Skin sensitisation is an immunological process that is described in two phases: the induction of sensitisation and the subsequent elicitation of the immune reaction. The first phase includes a sequential set of events which are described in this Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP). The molecular initiating event (MIE) is covalent binding to skin proteins (specifically, to cysteine and/or lysine residues) which leads to keratinocytes&#39; activation, a key event (KE) at cellular level. Another key event at cellular level is activation of dendritic cells, which is caused by hapten-protein complexes as well as by signalling from activated keratinocytes. Dendritic cells subsequently mature and migrate out of the epidermis to the local lymph node where they display major histocompatibility complex molecules, which include part of the hapten-protein complex to naive T-lymphocytes (T-cells). This induces differentiation and proliferation of allergen chemical-specific memory T-cells. This signifies the consecutive KE resulting in the acquisition of sensitisation, the adverse outcome on organ level. A sensitised subject has the capacity then to mount a more accelerated secondary response to the same chemical. Thus, if exposure occurs again, at the same or a different skin site, an aggressive immune response will be elicited resulting in allergic contact dermatitis.

	dcterms:description	"""An Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) represents the existing knowledge of a biological pathway leading from initial molecular interactions of a toxicant and progressing through a series of key events (KEs), culminating with an apical adverse outcome (AO) that has to be of regulatory relevance. An AOP based on the mode of action (MOA) of rodent liver tumor promotion by dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) has been developed and the weight of evidence (WoE) of key event relationships (KERs) evaluated using evolved Bradford Hill considerations. Dioxins and DLCs are potent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands that cause a range of species-specific adverse outcomes. The occurrence of KEs is necessary for inducing downstream biological responses and KEs may occur at the molecular, cellular, tissue and organ levels. The common convention is that an AOP begins with the toxicant interaction with a biological response element; for this AOP, this initial event is binding of a DLC ligand to the AHR. Data from mechanistic studies, lifetime bioassays and approximately thirty initiation-promotion studies have established a number of substances, including dioxin-like chemicals and indole-3-carbinol from brassica vegetables, as rat liver tumor promoters. Such studies clearly show that sustained AHR activation, weeks or months in duration, is necessary to induce rodent liver tumor promotion; hence, sustained AHR activation is deemed the molecular initiating event (MIE). After this MIE, subsequent KEs are 1) changes in cellular growth homeostasis likely associated with expression changes in a number of genes and observed as development of hepatic foci and decreases in apoptosis within foci; 2) extensive liver toxicity observed as the constellation of effects called toxic hepatopathy; 3) cellular proliferation and hyperplasia in several hepatic cell types. This progression of KEs culminates in the AO, the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas and cholangiolar carcinomas. A rich data set provides both qualitative and quantitative knowledge of the progression of this AOP through KEs and the KERs. Thus, the WoE for this AOP is judged to be strong. Species-specific effects of dioxins and DLCs are well known -- humans are less responsive than rodents and rodent species differ in sensitivity between strains. Consequently, application of this AOP to evaluate potential human health risks must take these differences into account.

	dcterms:description	"""This AOP describes one adverse outcome that may result from the inhibition of thyroperoxidase (TPO) during mammalian development. Chemical inhibition of TPO, the molecular-initiating event (MIE), results in decreased thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis, and subsequent reduction in circulating concentrations of THs. THs are essential for normal human brain development, both prenatally and postnatally, modulating genes critical for a normal neuroanatomical development, with subsequent effects on neurophysiology, and finally neurological function. Therefore, chemicals that interfere with TH synthesis have the potential to cause TH insufficiency that may result in adverse neurodevelopmental effects in offspring. Herein, we discuss the implications of developmental TPO inhibition for hippocampal anatomy, function, and ultimately neural function controlled by the hippocampus. The biochemistry of TPO and its essentiality for TH synthesis is well known across species. The hippocampus is known to be critically involved in cognitive, emotional, and memory function. The adverse consequences of TH insufficiency depend both on severity and developmental timing, indicating that exposure to TPO inhibitors may produce different effects at different developmental windows of exposure. It is important to note that thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is not a KE in this AOP. While TSH may play a role in feedback-driven compensatory processes, it is not directly involved in brain development. The overall weight of evidence for this AOP is strong. Gaps in our understanding include the relationship of TH-dependent gene expression and complexities of brain development. Although quantitative information at all levels of KERs is limited a number of applications of this AOP have been identified.

	dcterms:description	"""BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular system is the first functional organ system to develop in the vertebrate embryo, reflecting its critical role during normal development and pregnancy. Elucidating an AOP for embryonic vascular disruption must consider the stepwise events underlying blood vessel patterning. Vascular development commences in the early embryo with in situ formation of nascent vessels from angioblasts, leading to a primary capillary plexus (vasculogenesis). After the onset of blood circulation, the primary vascular pattern is further expanded as new vessels sprout from pre-existing vessels (angiogenesis). Both processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, are regulated by genetic signals and environmental factors dependent on anatomical region, physiological state, and developmental stage of the embryo. The developing vascular network is further shaped into a hierarchical system of arteries and veins, through progressive effects on blood vessel arborization, branching, and pruning (angioadaptation). These latter influences include hemodynamic forces, regional changes in blood flow, local metabolic demands and growth factor signals. Disruptions in embryonic vascular patterning-adaptation may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes, including birth defects, angiodysplasias and cardiovascular disease, intrauterine growth restriction or prenatal death. Some chemicals may act as potential vascular disrupting compounds (pVDCs) altering the expression, activity or function of molecular signals regulating blood vessel development and remodeling. Critical pathways involve receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., growth factor-signaling), G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., chemokine signaling), and GPI-anchored receptors (e.g. uPAR system).

DESCRIPTION: This AOP focuses on the regulation and disruption of vasculogenesis-angiogenesis during embryonic development via disruption of the VEGF-signaling pathway. VEGFA binding to its cognate receptor (VEGFR2) triggers angiogenic sprouting, growth and fusion during early development, and in flow-sensing adaptation of vascular development during later development. VEGFR2 inhibition, the postulated molecular initiating event (MIE) for this AOP, may be invoked by effects on VEGFA production, mobility, or receptor binding, and by effects on VEGFR2 cellular expression, molecular function or post-receptor signal transduction pathways. Downstream key events (KE) include altered cell fate and behavior of &#39;endothelial tip cells&#39; (exploratory behavior, cell migration) and endothelial &#39;stalk cells&#39; (cell proliferation, apoptosis). KE relationships (KERs) leading to vascular insufficiency then involve local interactions with other cell types (stromal cells, macrophages), the extracellular matrix (ECM) and micro-physiology (hemodynamics, metabolism). Adverse outcomes (AO) would ultimately vary by anatomical region, organ system, gestational stage and state of the embryo, fetus or placenta when an MIE is invoked.

RELEVANCE and APPLICATION: Angiogenesis and vascular disruption is a broad concept. The intended use of this AOP in a regulatory context is the predictive toxicology of developmental hazards, especially for integrating data from high-throughput screening (HTS) assays into cell agent-based models for predicting dysmorphogenesis. As part of an integrated assessment of toxicity, this AOP can identify useful information for assessing adverse outcomes relevant to risk assessment and efficient use of resources for validation through predictive models linking developmental toxicity to vascular disruption. AOP-based computer models that simulate vascular development can usher-in new virtual screening techniques to predict what might happen to a developing embryo when exposed to chemicals across different dose-time-stage scenarios, including the range of effects and how cellular injury propagates across development.

	dcterms:description	"""Under physiological conditions activation of glutamate ionotropic receptors such as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDARs), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPARs) and kainate (KARs) is responsible for basal excitatory synaptic transmission and main forms of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) that are fundamental for learning and memory processes (Schrattenholz and Soskic, 2006). However, sustained (direct or indirect) over-activation of these receptors can induce excitotoxic neuronal cell death. Indeed, mainly increased Ca2+ influx through NMDARs promotes many pathways of toxicity due to generation of free radical species, reduced ATP production, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and protein aggregation. Neuronal injury induced by over-activation of these receptors and the excessive Ca2+ influx is considered an early key event of excitotoxicity. Additionally, the excessive activation of NMDARs has been found to play a significant role in a variety of neurological disorders ranging from acute hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (Barenger et al., 2001) to chronic neurodegenerative diseases (Mehta et al., 2013). The proposed AOP is relevant to adult neurotoxicity testing. A molecular initiating event (MIE) has been defined as a direct binding of agonists to NMDARs or indirect, through prior activation of AMPARs and/or KARs resulting in sustained NMDARs over-activation causing excitotoxic neuronal cell death, mainly in hippocampus and cortex, two brain structures fundamental for learning and memory processes. The AOP is based on the empirical support describing (1) domoic acid (DomA) induced excitotoxicity triggered by indirect (through KARs/AMPARs) NMDARs over-activation leading to impaired learning and memory and (2) glufosinate (GLF) induced excitotoxicity that through direct binding to NMDARs causes convulsions and memory loss (Lanz et al., 2014). GLF is the methylphosphine analog of L-glutamate, used as a component of bactericidal and fungicidal herbicidal. DomA, a natural toxin that accumulates in mussels and shellfish is also an analogue of L-glutamate and among the most prominent features described after human exposure to DomA is memory impairment (Lefebvre and Robertson, 2010). DomA and GLF are described as the examples of the stressors due to large amounts of published data (especially in the case of DomA), however this AOP is relevant to any agonist that directly or indirectly cause NMDARs over-activation. Some of the known agonists selective for the NMDARs are derived from the naturally occurring amino acids such as ibotenic acid, homocysteine and l-aspartate and polyamines like spermidine.

	dcterms:description	"""The thyroid hormones (TH) are essential for brain development, maturation, and function as they regulate the early key developmental processes such as neurogenesis, cell migration, proliferation, myelination and neuronal and glial differentiation. Normal human brain development and cognitive function relays on sufficient production of TH during the perinatal period. The function of Na+/I- symporter (NIS) is critical for the physiological production of TH levels in the serum, as it is a membrane bound glycoprotein that mediates the transport of iodide form the bloodstream into the thyroid cells, and this constitutes the initial step for TH synthesis. NIS is a well-studied target of chemicals, and its inhibition results in decreased TH synthesis and its secretion into blood leading to subsequent TH insufficiency in the brain with detrimental effects in neurocognitive function in children. The present AOP describes causative links between inhibition of NIS function (the molecular initiating event) leading to the decreased levels of TH in the blood and consequently in the brain, causing learning and memory deficit in children (Adverse outcome). Learning and memory depend upon the coordinated action of different brain regions and neurotransmitter systems creating functionally integrated neural networks. Hippocampus and cortex are the most critical brain structures involved in the process of cognitive functions in rodents and primates, including man. The overall weight of evidence for this AOP is strong. The function of NIS and its essentiality for TH synthesis is well known across species, however, quantitative information of KERs is limited. &nbsp;

Natural toxins, such as tetrodotoxin, act in the same manner as a defensive or predatory venom. In neuro-muscular junctions, acetyl choline is released from the neuron, enters the synaptic cleft, and binds nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the post-synaptic muscle fiber, causing a slight local depolarization.  Sodium channels open in response to this depolarization, allowing sodium ions to enter the cell, causing rapid depolarization and the initiation of an action potential.  Depolarization of the muscle fiber triggers calcium channels to release calcium ions from internal stores.  The flood of calcium ions causes the muscle fiber to contract.  Inhibition of sodium channels has a direct effect on muscle contraction.  In fish and other aquatic organisms, exposure to sodium channel inhibitors results in slower swimming speeds and reduced feeding.

	dcterms:description	"""Anti-depressants such as fluoxetine and sertraline inhibit the reuptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) &nbsp;by blocking the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), causing an increase in serotonin levels at neural junctions. In molluscs, serotonergic neurons are responsible for the termination of the catch state of muscle contraction (Muneoka and Twarog, 1983). During catch, muscles contract and are resistant to stretch well after excitation by acetylcholine has stopped and intracellular Ca2+ stores return to normal. Importantly, this prolonged contraction is accomplished with minimal (or no) use of energy. While additional phyla may also be able to undergo catch contraction, the role of serotonin in releasing the contraction state appears to be unique to mollusks (Muneoka and Twarog, 1983). In bivalves, catch is used to maintain valve (shell) closure and the presence of serotonin promotes the transition from the passive state to active valve movement; exposure to 5-HTT inhibitors has been observed to cause increased valve movement in swan mussels (Cunha and Machado, 2001). Increased valve movement not only depletes the organism&rsquo;s energy reserves,but can cause excess water retention in the foot. This water retention is speculated to cause the foot detachment observed in mussels exposed to 5-HTT inhibitors (Cunha and Machado, 2001), although terrestrial gastropods also experience foot detachement (Pavlova 2001). Mussels in the unattached state expend greater energy [54] and are more susceptibility to predation than those attached to a substrate and clumped together (Casey and Chattopadhyay, 2008).

Serotonin has also been identified as a primary neurotransmitter used to control both ciliary and pedal foot locomotion in land and aquatic mollusks (Muneoka et al 1983, Pavlova 2001 , Gosselin 1961, Longley 2010). The specific impacts on locomotion, as well as the concentration-dependence, varies among molluscs because of differing physiology and life history strategies (Fong, 2014). In&nbsp;various&nbsp;bivalves, movement alterations may take the form of increased valve movement, locomotion and mantle display, and/or increased burrowing or burrowing (inappropriately) during daylight hours. The untimely and excessive movement of molluscs due to amplified serotonergic activity could feasibly enhance their visibility and/or diminish their energy reserves, making them more susceptible to predation. Recently, prolonged, low-dose (30-300 ng/L) exposures of mussels to fluoxetine were reported to cause decreases in filter feeding rates, energy reserves and growth (Peters 2016). Foot detachment mentioned above has also been attributed to disrupted coordination of pedal muscle cells and ciliated epithelium of the foot (Pavlova 2001).

	dcterms:description	"""Aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes, arising during meiosis in germ cells represents the most common chromosomal abnormality at birth and is the leading cause of pregnancy loss in humans. Aneuploidy can affect any chromosome, and data in rodents suggest that neither aneuploid sperm nor aneuploid oocytes are selected against at fertilization. Therefore, an increase in germ cell aneuploidy is expected to result in an increase in aneuploid pregnancies. The etiology of human aneuploidy is still not well understood, although there is strong evidence supporting a preferential occurrence during female meiosis I and a positive correlation with maternal age. There is extensive evidence in animal models that chemicals can induce aneuploidy by interfering with the proper functioning of the meiotic spindle and other aspects of chromosome segregation. Over 15 chemicals have been shown to induce aneuploidy in mammalian oocytes and the majority of these chemicals interfere with microtubule dynamics during meiosis. In addition to these animals studies, there is also one reported case in which environmental exposure to trichlorfon, an organophosphate insecticide, resulted in a cluster of Down syndrome cases among women in an Hungarian community. The present AOP focuses on the induction of aneuploidy in mammalian oocytes as a consequence of chemical binding to tubulin (MIE). In this AOP, chemicals that bind to tubulin lead to the depolymerization of microtubules (KE1). Extensive microtubule depolymerisation leads to meiotic spindle disorganization (KE2), which in turns lead to altered chromosome dynamics (KE3) and the generation of aneuploidy oocytes (KE4). Aneuploidy oocytes can be fertilized and generate aneuploidy offspring (AO). There is ample empirical evidence supporting this AOP and the overall weight of evidence is strong.

	dcterms:description	"""The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR; NR1I3)&nbsp;is a mammalian nuclear receptor that is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes following its activation by xenobiotics or endogenous ligands.&nbsp;&nbsp;Activation of CAR in the liver of rats and mice leads to altered gene expression, including genes related to Phase 1 and Phase 2 metabolism, transporters, gluconeogenesis, lipid homeostasis,&nbsp;cell cycle control and apoptosis regulation. This AOP describes the sequence of key events (KEs) that occur in rats and mice following&nbsp;chronic exposure to CAR activators, which leads from activation of CAR to an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. The molecular initiating event (MIE) is activation of the CAR nuclear receptor, either by direct binding of a ligand or by an indirect mechanism (e.g. as with phenobarbital), both of which allow the CAR protein to translocate to&nbsp;the nucleus and alter expression of CAR target genes. In rats and mice, CAR activation alters the expression of certain genes related to cell cycle control, producing changes resulting in a pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic environment. These gene expression changes (KE1) lead to an increase in mitogenic cell proliferation (KE2). In this proliferative environment, a higher number of spontaneously mutated hepatocytes can form. &nbsp;With longer time intervals, the mutated hepatocytes clonally expand into pre-neoplastic altered foci (KE2). Eventually, under continued CAR activation, the pre-neoplastic foci expand to form hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas, the adverse outcome (AO). Based on a wide dataset of testing with CAR activators, this AOP is considered to only be operative in mice and rats, and not in other mammalian species including humans. Good dose concordance between the early KEs,&nbsp;associated biological markers of the&nbsp;KEs&nbsp;and the AO have been demonstrated with example molecules. A potential application of this AOP is to guide future risk assessments, where dose-response values for critical early key events, e.g. NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) or BMDL (Benchmark Dose Lower Limit) values, may be useful endpoints. Another potential application of this AOP is to highlight how methods for assessment of the MIE and/or the early KEs can be reliably used to demonstrate that a CAR mode of action is operative for a particular molecule, avoiding large scale use of animal testing to demonstrate every KE in the proposed pathway.

The disorder is due to a homozygous mutation in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), an enzyme involved in the heme biosynthesis pathway [4], or may be chemically induced, which involves the inhibition of UROD. This adverse outcome pathway (AOP) describes the linkages leading to chemically induced porphyria through the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor.&nbsp; AHR activation leads to the induction of cytochrome P450 1A2, a phase I metabolizing enzyme, which in turn results in excessive oxidation of uroporphyrinogen.&nbsp; This oxidation produces a UROD inhibitor, preventing the conversion of uroporphyrinogen to coprouroporphyrinogen and increasing the synthesis of the UROD inhibitor in a positive feedback loop. The accumulation of uroporphyrinogen leads to its preferential oxidation and accumulation of HCP in various organs (Uroporphyria).&nbsp; This AOP was developed in accordance with OECD guidelines and demonstrates a high degree of confidence as a qualitative AOP. The quantitative understanding of this AOP however is not yet complete, preventing the accurate prediction of uroporphyria from lower level key events.

	dcterms:description	"""This AOP describes one adverse outcome that results from the inhibition of the sodium iodine symporter (NIS) during mammalian development. Inhibition of NIS, the molecular-initiating event (MIE), results in decreased iodine uptake, decreased thyroidal iodine content, subsequent decreased synthesis of thyroid hormones (THs), and reduction in circulating levels of THs. THs are essential for normal human brain development, both prenatally and postnatally. Therefore, chemicals that interfere with TH synthesis have the potential to cause TH insufficiency that may result in adverse neurodevelopmental effects in offspring. This AOP includes changes in brain TH concentrations and subsequent impacts on hippocampal development that lead to declines in cognitive spatial behavior. The weight of evidence for this AOP is strong. And, while there are currently computational quantitative models that can predict serum TH levels from NIS inhibition, there is currently a lack of quantitative understanding of the degree of serum TH disruption that leads to the adverse outcome.

	dcterms:description	"""The rodent olfactory epithelium is uniquely sensitive to cytotoxicity induced by exposure to inhaled compounds. Sustained cytotoxicity of the olfactory epithelium is a common precursor for the development of nasal tumors. This AOP describes intracellular pH reduction initiation of cytotoxicity leading to the development of olfactory tumors in rodents. Increased production or reduced buffering of protons in cells comprising the olfactory epithelium that exceed homeostatic control mechanisms and cause intracellular acidification is the MIE for this AOP. Reductions in cellular pH sufficient to denature or alter key cellular apparatus (enzymes, proteins) cause cytotoxicity. Sustained cytotoxicity of cell types comprising the olfactory epithelium, (e.g. olfactory sensory neurons, sustentacular cells, Bowmans glands) causes cell death and a reduction in cell numbers/volume of cells. Tissue necrosis, degeneration (deterioration and loss of function) and atrophy (reduction in tissue mass), are observed. Sustained atrophy/degeneration leads to adaptive tissue remodeling, where cell types unique to olfactory epithelium are replaced by cell types comprising respiratory epithelium or squamous epithelium. Tissue remodeling increases cell division rates. Mutations in critical genes accumulate under the combined influences of increased cell proliferation and cytotoxicity and cellular stress, which together increase the probability of mutation. Continued cell proliferation and accumulation of mutations in critical genes eventually leads to tumors arising from regions of the nasal epithelium that normally are composed of olfactory epithelium.

	dcterms:description	"""Hepatotoxicity is known to be an important endpoint of regulatory concern; especially in drug development it has been one of the most frequent reasons for pharmacovigilance safety reports and withdrawal of drugs from the market. Liver inflammation can be both the relevant endpoint itself, or it occurs during development of liver fibrosis, for example, upon repeated exposure. The current AOP links lysosomal disruption to liver inflammation. Lysosomal damage can be caused by multiple initiators: examples are the detergent O-methyl-serine dodecylamide hydrochloride (MSDH), alpha-tocopheryl succinate, naphthazarine [1] [2], 3-aminopropanal [2], the antimalarial agent artesunate (ART) [3] and also nanomaterials (NMs) [4]. Lysosomal rupture by NMs has been described as one of the main causes for their potential to induce cellular damage, which is subsequently linked to an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial damage and induction of the inflammatory cascade. Liver inflammation is therefore a local outcome following translocation of NMs to the liver. Uptake and disruption of the lysosome is not a classical MIE, as no &quot;molecular&quot; but rather mechanical processes are involved. However, it is the initiating event for the described AOP.

	dcterms:description	"""Hypertension is a cardiovascular risk factor that has a profound influence on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&nbsp; While good progress has been made in terms of identifying and managing this risk factor for patient care, methods to assess the potential of chemical compounds to induce hypertension, or to assess the efficacy of consumer products (e.g. e-cigarettes, tobacco heating products) targeted at reducing disease burden remain largely limited to epidemiological associations and in vivo studies.&nbsp;

Here we present the supporting information on an AOP describing how vascular endothelial peptide oxidation leads to hypertension via perturbation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. &nbsp;The molecular initiating event is oxidation of amino acid (AA) residues on critical peptides of the NO pathway, notably protein kinase B (AKT), guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-1 (GTPCH-1), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and also the cellular ROS scavenger; glutathione. &nbsp;Oxidation of the enzymic components of the pathway lead to reduced expression of the&nbsp;phosphorylated proteins, and protein loss via proteasomal degradation.&nbsp;Oxidation of reduced glutathione to GSSG promotes bonding of GSSG to critical AA residues on eNOS, and the reduced expression of GTPCH-1 reduces bioavailability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), both of which lead&nbsp;to uncoupling of eNOS (reduced NO production, increased superoxide production). &nbsp;The combination of these molecular events lead to reduced bioavailabilty of NO, which in turn reduces the potential for vasodilation and shifts the balance of vascular tone towards vasoconstriction. &nbsp;Repeated perturbation of this pathway via chronic exposure to toxicants, ultimately increases vascular resistance and contributes towards the development of hypertension.

The evidence supporting the AOP is&nbsp;strong from the molecular level up to impaired vasodilation,&nbsp;however there is a knowledge gap concerning the magnitude of&nbsp;contribution of this mechanism towards the development of hypertension, given the complexity of the disorder. &nbsp;Further AOPs are likely required to characterise the contribution of competing/promoting mechanisms which alter vascular tone towards chronic vasoconstriction.

With respect to the regulatory context, the AOP is of relevance to the risk assessment of airborne pollutants and other chronically inhaled toxicants which affect vascular endothelial cells. Additionally, acute and chronic exposure to aerosols generated by alternative tobacco products and nicotine delivery devices are poorly understood with respect to their impact on cardiovascular disease risk. Reliable in vitro models and human clinical biomarkers would help to inform regulatory decision-making with respect to understanding the potential cardiovascular health impacts of these novel products.

	dcterms:description	"""Interference with endogenous developmental processes that are regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), through sustained exogenous activation, causes molecular, structural, and functional cardiac abnormalities in avian, mammalian and piscine embryos; this cardiotoxicity ultimately leads to severe edema and embryo death in birds and fish and some strains of rat (Carney et al. 2006; Huuskonen et al. 1994; Kopf and Walker 2009). There have been numerous proposed mechanisms of action for this toxicity profile, many of which include the dysregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a key event, as it is essential for normal vasculogenesis and therefore cardiogenesis (Ivnitski-Steele and Walker 2005). This AOP describes the indirect suppression of VEGF expression through the sequestration of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) by AHR. ARNT is common dimerization partner for both AHR and hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF-1&alpha;), which stimulates angiogenesis through the transcriptional regulation of VEGF (Ivnitski-Steele and Walker 2005).&nbsp; There is considerable cross talk between these two signaling pathways (AHR and HIF-1&alpha;), leading to the hypothesis that AHR activation leads to sustained AHR/ARNT dimerization and reduced HIF-1&alpha;/ARNT dimerization, preventing the adequate transcription of essential angiogenic factors, such as VEGF. The suppression of VEGF thereby reduces cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell proliferation, altering cardiovascular morphology and reducing cardiac output, which ultimately leads to congestive heart failure and death (Lanham et al. 2014).

The biological plausibility of this AOP is strong, and there is significant evidence in the literature to support it; however, there exist some contradictory data regarding the effect of AHR on VEGF, which seem highly dependent on tissue type and life stage. There are also multiple targets of AHR activation, such as the COX-2 signaling pathway, that could potentially interact.&nbsp; These contradictions and alternate pathways are discussed below. The quantitative understanding of individual key even relationships (KERs) in this AOP is weak; however, there is a strong correlation between the molecular initiating event (MIE: AHR activation) and adverse outcome (AO: embryolethality), and a quantitative relationship is described for birds.

Binding of TTR by a xenobiotic (the MIE) during certain developmental windows may disrupt the normal neurodevelopment of mammals through a transient increase in free thyroxine (T4) levels, permitting increased tissue uptake of thyroid hormone (TH), followed by a decrease in both serum and neuronal tissue concentrations. Due to the highly conserved nature of the TTR protein, birds, reptiles, fish and amphibians can also express TTR and be impacted by interference by xeniobiotics. The adverse consequences of TH insufficiency depend both on the severity and developmental timing, indicating that exposure to thyroid toxicants may produce different effects at different developmental windows of exposure. This AOP discusses the potential for developmental TTR interference to adversely impact hippocampal anatomy, function, gene expression and, ultimately, cognitive function.

	dcterms:description	"""Calcineurin (CN) is a type of protein phosphatase that is known to impair immune function when its phosphatase activation is inhibited. The relationship between CN and immune functions is well understood, and immunosuppressants that work by inhibiting CN have been developed.

CN inhibitors (CNIs) inhibit CN phosphatase activity to suppress many kinds of immune functions. &nbsp;T-cell dependent antibody response (TDAR) is considered to be the most important endpoint on evaluating immunotoxicity of chemicals; therefore, this AOP describes the linkage between the inhibition of CN activity and impairment of TDAR.

CN activity is inhibited when stressors of CNIs bind to CN with their respective immunophilins, which interferes with the nuclear localization of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a substrate of CN. As a result, the formation of functional NFAT complexes with activator protein-1 (AP-1) that bind at the site of IL-2, IL-4 and other T cell -derived cytokine promoters is reduced, thereby suppressing production of these cytokines. Thus, reduced production of IL-2 and IL-4 affects the proliferation and differentiation of B-cells to suppress TDAR.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We have identified a number of key events along this pathway and determined the key event relationships, based on which we have created an AOP for inhibition of CN activity leading to impaired TDAR.

Since CN expresses in cells among vast variety of species, this AOP might be applicable to many mammal species, including humans and rodents.

Chemicals interfering with the conversion of T4 to T3 have the potential to inhibit posterior chamber inflation which may result in reduced swimming capacity of the fish, a relevant adverse outcome that can affect feeding behaviour and predator avoidance, resulting in lower survival probability and ultimately population trajectory decline (Czesny et al., 2005; Woolley and Qin, 2010).

	dcterms:description	"""The AOP describes the effects of inhibition of deiodinase 1 (DIO1) on anterior swim bladder inflation leading to reduced young of year survival and population trajectory decline. The inhibition of DIO1 is the molecular-initiating event (MIE), which results in decreased circulating concentrations of triiodothyronine (T3) in serum. Disruption of the thyroid hormone (TH) system is increasingly being recognized as an important MoA that can lead to adverse outcomes, especially during embryonic development. In fish, many different adverse effects during early development resulting from disruption of the TH endocrine system have been reported (e.g., effects on body and eye size, head-to-trunk angle, heartbeat, otolith formation, pigmentation index, swim bladder inflation, hatching time, somite formation, escape response and photoreceptor development). As in amphibians, the transition in fish between the different developmental phases, including maturation and inflation of the swim bladder, have been shown to be mediated by THs. Fish larvae exposed to PTU, a known DIO1 inhibitor, has been known to result in impairment of swim bladder inflation. Chemicals interfering with the conversion of T4 to T3 have the potential to inhibit anterior chamber inflation which may result in reduced auditory capacity and reduced swimming capacity of the fish, a relevant adverse outcome that can affect feeding behaviour and predator avoidance, resulting in lower survival probability and ultimately population trajectory decline (Czesny et al., 2005; Woolley and Qin, 2010).

	dcterms:description	"""This adverse outcome pathway (AOP) describes the linkages between the interaction of substances with the cellular membrane components and the lung fibrosis. Lung fibrosis is a dysregulated or an exaggerated tissue repair process. It denotes the presence of scar tissue in the alveolar capillary region of the lung where gas exchange occurs; it can be localised or more diffuse involving bronchi and pleura. The process involves intricate dynamics between several inflammatory and immune response cells, and the microenvironment of the alveolar-capillary membrane consisting of both immune and non-immune cells, and the lung interstitium, in the presence of sustained or repeated toxicant stimuli. Regardless of the type of stimulus, the interaction between the substance and components of the cellular membrane leading to release of danger signals/alarmins marks the first event, which is a molecular initiating event (MIE) in the process of tissue repair. As a consequence, a myriad of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators are secreted (Key Event (KE) 1) that signal the recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells into the lungs (KE2). The MIE, KE1, and KE2 represent the same functional changes that are collectively known as inflammation, the purpose of which is to clear the invading pathogen or toxic substance. In the presence of continuous stimulus or persistent toxic substances, tissue injury ensues leading to the alveolar capillary membrane integrity loss (KE3) and activation of adaptive immune response. The purpose of the adaptive immune response is to resolve the inflammation and initiate healing process, involving activation of the T Helper type 2 cell signalling (KE4), during which anti-inflammatory and pro-repair/fibrotic molecules continue to be secreted. Once the healing process is initiated, fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation is induced (KE5) leading to synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix or collagen (KE6). Exaggerated collagen deposition leads to alveolar septa thickening, decrease in total lung volume, and lung fibrosis (Adverse Outcome). It is important to note that many of the individual KEs occur in parallel, early after exposure to fibrogenic stimuli and thus, it is difficult to establish key event relationships (KERs). The eventual clinical manifestation of the disease is influenced by the physical-chemical properties of the substance and duration of exposure.

Lung fibrosis can be induced by many substances, microorganisms or by over expression of specific inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines. This AOP is also applicable to materials such as nanomaterials that induce an inflammatory response as well as possess unique properties that allow for significant chronicity of the response, which takes place deep within the lung, beyond the airways and within the alveoli. Lung fibrosis occurs in humans and the key biological events involved are similar as the ones observed in animals. Thus, this AOP provides a detailed mechanistic account of the process of lung fibrosis across species.

	dcterms:description	"""This AOP describes how decreased thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis via chemical inhibition of thyroperoxidase (TPO) causes delayed amphibian metamorphosis, or in extreme cases, arrested development.  Amphibian metamorphosis is mediated by TH and successful completion of metamorphosis is generally required for organism survival.  TPO is a critical enzyme in the thyroid hormone synthesis pathway that iodinates tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin and also couples the iodinated tyrosines to form thyroxine (T4).  Conversion of T4 to the active hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), is catalyzed by the major activating enzyme, type II iodothyronine deiodinase (see deiodinase pAOP), located within the peripheral organs and tissues.  T3 then binds to thyroid hormone receptor (THR) along with other cofactors allowing transcriptional gene activation.  This T3-mediated gene expression drives the anatomical and physiological changes encompassed by the metamorphic process including limb emergence and development, lung development, gill and tail resorption, gut remodeling, metabolic profile changes in the liver, skin keratinization, etc.  The weight of evidence for this AOP is strong, as TPO inhibition has been studied extensively in amphibian model species Xenopus laevis during larval development.  Model TPO inhibitors methimazole and 6-propylthiouracil, in addition to other TPO inhibitors such as 2-mercaptobenzothiazole and benzophenone-2, have been tested in this species using several in vivo study designs, some aiming to characterize temporal profiles of glandular hormone levels in addition to serum hormone levels and associated thyroid gland histopathology.  These studies lend strong support for essentiality of events proximal to, and including, the MIE.  Downstream, the relationship between blood and tissue TH levels is driven by a host of active transport proteins that have begun to be characterized in mammalian models, whereas THR-mediated gene expression profiles have been studied extensively in the amphibian model.  However, less is known about quantitative relationships and essentiality of these downstream events, which generally lacks importance due to the strong indirect relationship between circulating hormone levels and delayed metamorphosis.

	dcterms:description	"""This AOP describes how intracellular iodine deficits in thyroid follicular cells via chemical inhibition of sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) decrease thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis and cause delayed amphibian metamorphosis, or in extreme cases, arrests development.  Amphibian metamorphosis is mediated by TH and successful completion of metamorphosis is generally required for organism survival.  NIS is a critical transport protein that mediates iodine uptake into thyroid follicular cells making it available for thyroperoxidase (see TPO AOP) to catalyze its covalent bonding to tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin.  TPO subsequently couples the iodinated tyrosines to form thyroxine (T4).  Conversion of T4 to the active hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), is catalyzed by type I or II deiodinase enzymes (see DIO1 and DIO2 pAOPs) located within the peripheral organs and tissues, which then binds to thyroid receptor (TR).  Activated TR then stimulates gene expression that drives the anatomical and physiological changes encompassed by the metamorphic process including limb emergence and development, lung development, gill and tail resorption, gut remodeling, metabolic profile changes in the liver, skin keratinization, etc.  The model NIS inhibitor, perchlorate, has been tested in amphibian model species Xenopus laevis using in vivo study designs aiming to characterize temporal profiles of glandular hormone levels in addition to serum hormone levels and associated thyroid gland histopathology.  Although there are only a few studies in amphibians that directly address NIS inhibition, these studies provide a strong weight of evidence supporting the specificity and essentiality of NIS inhibition leading to well-supported essential key events downstream.

	dcterms:description	"""This putative adverse outcome pathway describes the linkage between inhibition of iodotyrosine deiodinase (dehalogenase, IYD) and altered amphibian metamorphosis. Initial development of this AOP is based largely on IYD literature of clinical evidence in humans, rat model experiments, and biochemical and genetic analyses. The enzyme IYD catalyzes the recycling of iodide from the byproducts of thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis [monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT)] within the thyroid gland as well as other organs, including liver and kidney. IYD protects against excretion of critical iodide and promotes accumulation of iodide in thyroid follicular cells for TH synthesis, which is especially critical for low iodine diets and low iodine environments (including most freshwater ecosystems). Therefore, failure or chemical inhibition of IYD could reduce TH synthesis, resulting in TH insufficiency in tissues and subsequent altered development. Failure of this enzyme in humans, due to mutations in the IYD gene (DEHAL1), has been shown to have negative developmental consequences, including hypothyroidism, goiter, and mental retardation. In rat exposures with suspected IYD inhibitors, serum T4 and T3 were reduced, thyroid gland size and TSH increased, and weight gain was reduced. Additionally, IYD has been shown to be a potential chemical target for thyroid axis disruption through in vitro inhibition assays with polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, agrichemicals, antiparasitics, pharmaceuticals, and food colorants. This molecular initiating event, inhibition of IYD, may have broad taxonomic applicability; IYD genes are highly conserved across a wide range of multicellular organisms with evidence that iodide salvage is important for many species.

Initial development of this AOP is based on literature in which amphibian deiodinases are genetically disrupted and prediction from tissue expression patterns. Chemical inhibition of DIO1, the molecular-initiating event (MIE), results in decreased transformation of thyroxine (T4) to the active form, 3,5,3‚Äô-triiodothyronine (T3), but also decreased inactivation of T3 to 3,3‚Äô,5‚Äô-triiodothyronine (rT3). Thyroid hormones (THs) are essential for normal sequential development of amphibian tissues and organs, and activities of the three deiodinases found in amphibians, as in mammals, function in a highly regulated balance. Therefore, chemicals that interfere with the DIO1 catalyzing reaction of T4 to T3 have the potential to cause insufficiency of the active form, but also disrupt the balance between active T3 and inactive rT3. Consequences of T4/T3/rT3 imbalance may vary based on timing of exposure and produce different effects in different tissues at different developmental stages. For example, T3 insufficiency due to DIO1 inhibition in the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, within several days post-fertilization (pre-metamorphosis) could affect brain development, and like the DIO2 enzyme, DIO1 inhibition in peripheral tissues through the larval phase and post-metamorphic climax may cause alterations in limb development, intestinal remodeling, gill resorption and/or tail resorption.

Initial development of this AOP is based on literature in which amphibian deiodinases are genetically disrupted and prediction from tissue expression patterns. Chemical inhibition of DIO3, the molecular-initiating event (MIE), results in decreased transformation of thyroxine (T4) to the inactive form, 3,3‚Äô,5‚Äô-triiodothyronine (reverse T3, or rT3) and also decreased transformation of T3 to inactive form T2 in peripheral tissues. Thyroid hormones (THs), including appropriate levels of the inactive rT3 form, are essential for normal sequential development of amphibian tissues and organs, and activities of the three deiodinases found in amphibians, as in mammals, function in a highly regulated balance. Therefore, chemicals that interfere with the DIO3 catalyzing reaction of T4 inner-ring deiodination (IRD) to rT3 have the potential to cause overabundance of T4 as well as the active T3 form, potentially resulting in altered metamorphic development. Adverse consequences of rT3 insufficiency may vary based on timing of exposure and produce different effects at different developmental stages. In the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, DIO3 seems to be predominant during the early pre-metamorphosis development phase, protecting tissues from the actions of TH. Inhibition of DIO3 could alter T4/T3/rT3 feedback balance causing events that normally occur during pro-metamorphosis and post-metamorphic climax to occur too early and result in alterations in limb development, intestinal remodeling, gill resorption and/or tail resorption.

	dcterms:description	"""Pulmonary irritation induced by chemical exposure can be divided into two types. One type of irritation, corrosive irritation causes inflammation from tissue destruction and appears to be limited to inhalation of industrial chemicals for example hydrochloric acid, chlorine gas, and ammonia. The second type, sensory irritation is caused by sensory stimulation mediated by activation of specific receptors located in the trigeminal nerve endings and occurs at concentrations that do not result in tissue destruction. Our focus is to develop an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) for sensory irritants. &nbsp;Many inhalable chemicals are sensory irritants (Alarie et al 1966, 1973, Schaper et al., 1993) that can cause physiological responses including pain, mucus production, nasal obstruction, sneezing, coughing, and decreases in respiration rate (Brunning et al., 2014). The target organ of respiratory irritants is ultimately the airways causing inflammation of the trachea, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis. A receptor present in the upper airways is the TRPA1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, member 1) that induces a physiological response to make the subject aware of the presence of chemicals and initiate several defensive biological responses. A wide range of chemicals activates TRPA1 (Bessac and Jordt, 2010). The activation of TRPA1 acts as a gatekeeper of inflammation/irritation and is a critical endpoint in the regulation of exposure to volatile organic chemicals (Bautista et al., 2013; Lehman et al., 2015).

	dcterms:description	"""Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC), particularly estrogen receptor (ER) agonists, are thought to contribute to the incidence of breast cancer. The majority (approximately 75 percent) of breast cancer cases express the estrogen receptor. Both animal and human studies strongly support that activation of the estrogen receptor stimulates breast cancer development and progression. We created the ER-mediated breast cancer AOP to frame how ER activation (the MIE) leads to breast cancer (the AO). For more information regarding the AOP, refer to the Morgan &amp; Johnson et al. (2015) citation.

Activation of the estrogen receptor in breast epithelial cells stimulates genomic and non-genomic changes, which alters epithelial gene expression and subsequent protein production. Consequently, breast epithelial cells experience increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis, dysfunction of mitochondrial dynamics, increased DNA damage, increased cell motility, and increased oxidative stress. These cellular changes translate to a tissue level where ductal hyperplasia and cell invasion is increased.

While breast epithelial cells are the cancer cell type in ER+ adenocarcinomas, other cell types of the microenvironment interact with the AOP. For example, endothelial cells express ER and upon ER activation, undergo gene expression and protein production changes. Consequently, endothelial cell proliferation and migration is increased, leading to increased angiogenesis, which supports the proliferation of breast cancer epithelial cells. While estrogens do not target fibroblasts, adipocytes, or macrophages directly, they become activated as breast cancer progresses. It is not well understood if there is a direct relationship between estrogen signaling and stromal cell activation, however, activated cells stimulate cancer cell proliferation, influence chemical response, increase cell motility, and rearrange the extracellular matrix. Moreover, adipocytes contribute to the AOP through metabolism of testosterone to estrogen, and fibroblasts have been shown to regulate estrogen receptor regulated genes in epithelial cells. Therefore, due to how the breast microenvironment interacts with and stimulates the AOP, we have included activation of these cell types into our framework.

Overall, the ER-mediated breast cancer AOP is a useful framework that can identify both readouts and components of the breast microenvironment that are important in disease progression.

	dcterms:description	"""Endocrine disruption (ED) associated with environmental sex determination (ESD) and reproduction effects has been frequently reported in various ecotoxicologcail studies with crustaceans, such as daphniids (reviewed in (LeBlanc and Medlock, 2015)). Daphniids normally go through parthenogenic reproduction cycles in which only female offspring are produced. When under environmental stress (e.g. chemical exposure, short length of daylight, food shortage and high population density), a switch of reproductive strategy from asexual to sexual reproduction occurs and male offspring are produced. As an indicator of ED, the induction of male offspring is used as an important endpoint in daphnia toxicity tests. It has been widely recognized that analogs of the crustacean juvenile hormone (JH), methyl farnesoate (MF) are able to bind and activate the crustacean JH receptor, methoprene tolerant (Met), thus inducing the putative sex determination genes, doublesex genes, and causing male offspring formation. The induction of male neonates is usually associated with reduced fecundity and population decline as adverse ED effects. The existing evidences from different studies currently support the causal relationships between the biological events occurred in daphniids after exposure to JH analogs and subsequently form an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) as proposed herein.

	dcterms:description	"""Infant leukaemia is a rare haematological disease (1 in 106 newborns, accounting for 10% of all childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL)) manifesting soon after birth (&lt;1 year) and having a poor prognosis (Sanjuan-Pla et al 2015). Compared to the more frequent childhood leukaemia, infant leukaemia show distinct features:


	An early neonatal onset linked to its plausible origin as a &lsquo;intrauterine developmental disease&rsquo; (Greaves 2015; Sanjuan-Pla et al 2015);
	Rearrangements of the mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL; KMT2A) gene on the q23 band of chromosome 11, as the hallmark genetic abnormality (Joannides and Grimwade 2010);
	However, MLL is not the only translocation gene; for infant ALL, about 60-80% carry an MLL rearrangement (Sam et al.2012; Jansen et al.2007) and the percentage for infant acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is about 40 %;
	The MLL rearrangement at an early stage of development; the likely target cells (still unidentified) are the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) in fetal liver and/or earlier (mesenchymal) stem cells in embryonic mesoderm (Bueno et al 2009; Menendez et al 2009);
	The infant MLL-rearranged leukaemia carries less somatic mutations (1.3 vs 6.5/case) than the childhood disease (Andersson et al 2015; Dobbins et al 2013), pointing to the lack of a &ldquo;second hit&rdquo; and suggesting a &ldquo;one big hit&rdquo; origin.


Following these distinct features a molecular Initiating Event (MIE) a Key Event (KE) and an Adverse Outcome (AO) were identified. The MIE was identified as &quot;In-utero exposure DNA topoisomerase II poisons&quot;; relationship to in-utero exposure was considered relevant to make a specific relationship with the AO (Infant Leukaemia) as epidemiological studies suggested that in-utero exposure to topoisomerases 2 may be involved in generation of the KE,&nbsp;in-utero MLL chromosomal rearrangement.

Overall, based on the available evidence, infant leukaemia pathogenesis originates from a single, severe hit to a target cell during early intrauterine development. Whereas the limited epidemiological studies do not allow any firm conclusion on a possible role for chemicals in infant leukaemia (Pombo-de-Oliveira et al 2006; Ferreira et al 2013), exposures to chemicals able to induce MLL rearrangements through topoisomerase II (TopoII) &ldquo;poison&rdquo;, particularly etoposide and other TopoII &ldquo;poisons&rdquo;, including some bioflavonoids, have been suggested as agents promoting the driver genetic oncogenic event. Experimental models for infant leukaemia have been developed, but a wholly satisfactory model reproducing the phenotype and latency is not yet available.

Nevertheless, the anticancer drug etoposide can be considered as a model chemical for DNA topoisomerase &ldquo;poison&rdquo;. Acute leukaemia is an adverse effect recorded in etoposide-treated patients, showing MLL rearrangements that are in many ways analogous to those in infant leukaemia (Bueno et al 2009; Joannides et al 2010, 2011). Therefore the proposed AOP is supported by a number of convincing inferential evidences by means of using etoposide as a tool compound to empirically support the linkage between the proposed molecular initiating event (MIE) and the adverse outcome (AO). In the meanwhile, this AOP identifies several knowledge gaps, the main ones being the identification of the initiating cell and the investigation of TopoII poisons in a robust model; thus, the present AOP may be modified in future on the basis of new evidence. The authors recognize that additional elements are limiting the strenght of this AOP, in particular that the empirical support is mainly based on one chemical stressor and that essentiality data are also limited and difficult to generate; however, the biological plausibility for the proposed sequence of events for this AOP was considered strong.&nbsp;

Exposure of native freshwater mussels to fluoxetine induced premature release of glochidia resulting in non-viable larvae (Bringolf 2010). One review of fluoxetine effects in aquatic species noted that concentrations observed to impact the reproductive endpoints of mussels can far exceed environmental exposure levels (Sumpter 2014), and this may be a limitation of several key events depicted in this AOP network.

Being a rather comprehensive term, it is not surprising that the pathways leading to basal cytotoxicity are quite generic. Nevertheless, a  tentative AOP to basal cytotoxicity could consist of 3 consecutive steps. The first step involves initial cell injury caused by the parent chemical and/or its metabolites. In the second step, a mitochondrial dysfunction takes place as a consequence of the primary insult. This ultimately leads to cell death in the third step.

It is an immunological process that is known to be regulated by the immune modulator Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors &gamma; (PPAR&gamma;) and transforming growth factor &beta; (TGF-&beta;). PPAR&gamma; ligands antagonize the profibrotic effects of TGF-&beta; in which induce differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, a critical effector cell in fibrosis. These sequential set of events are described in this Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP). The molecular initiating event (MIE) is inactivation of PPAR&gamma; which leads to TGF-&beta; inactivation, a key event (KE) at molecular level. Next, key event at cellular level is differentiation of Myofibroblast and expression of collagen gene by activated TGF-&beta; signaling pathway. Differentiated myofibroblast subsequently produce &alpha;-smooth muscle actin (&alpha;-SMA) and overexpressed collagen deposits in lung tissue. This consecutive KE resulting in the acquisition of the accumulation of excess fibrous connective tissue, the adverse outcome on pulmonary fibrosis. Scar formation, the accumulation of excess fibrous connective tissue (the process called fibrosis), leads to thickening of the walls, and causes reduced oxygen supply in the blood. As a consequence patients suffer from perpetual shortness of breath.

The intracellular mechanisms of induction of the spermatocyte apoptosis by HDIs are suggested as HDAC inhibition as MIE, histone acetylation increase, p21 expression increase, disrupted cell cycle, apoptosis, and spermatocyte depletion as KEs. Adverse outcome includes testicular toxicity. The HDIs inhibit deacetylation of the histone, leading to the increase in histone acetylation, followed by increase in p21 gene expression. The apoptosis induced by disrupted cell cycle leads to spermatocyte depletion and testis atrophy. We propose new AOP for HDAC inhibition leading to testicular toxicity. This AOP may be one of the pathways induced by HDIs, which suggests the networks of the pathways with hyperacetylations of cellular proteins other than histones.

NASH is on a spectrum of liver disease, starting at steatosis and ultimately leading to cirrhosis (liver fibrosis) if chemical exposure and injury continues. This AOP is focused on fatty acid beta oxidation and its contribution as a molecular initiating event in the formation of NASH. Steatosis is ultimately a net increase in fatty acids within hepatocytes. This can be from a net decrease in efflux (e.g., influx &gt;&gt; efflux), a net decrease in overall fatty acid oxidation/metabolism to glucose and intermediates, or a combination of these factors. In this AOP, our MIE is the inhibition of fatty acid beta oxidation (FABO). This leads to an overall increase in fatty acids. These fatty acids undergo lipid peroxidation resulting in fatty acid free radicals. When the reduction potential of the cell is overwhelmed, the free radicals lead to oncotic cell death, and the release of signals that stimulate inflammatory cell infiltration.

	dcterms:description	"""This AOP details the downstream events of CYP7B inhibition leading to a decreased locomotor&nbsp;activity that adversely impacts reproductive success. CYP7B is expressed in the&nbsp;brain and catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone to&nbsp;7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone, a neurosteroid that stimulates the release of dopamine in the telencephalon. When released through this pathway, dopamine binds D2 receptor&nbsp;which is involved in locomotor activity induction.&nbsp;Ketoconazole and other azole fungicides&nbsp;are potent inhibitor of cytochrome&nbsp;P450s, including CYP7B. They bind to the heme site of the enzyme preventing its catalytic activity. Exposure to one of these molecules induces a decrease in&nbsp;7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone synthesis&nbsp;which, in turn, reduces&nbsp;dopamine release in the telencephalon and limits locomotor activity. Since locomotor activity is closely associated to reproductive success through&nbsp;courtship enhancement (newt), expansion of territory (bird) and homing migration (salmon), its inhibition negatively affects the fitness of&nbsp;animals.&nbsp;

7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone was recently discovered and its function and regulation remain unclear. The few studies that focused on this neurosteroid and that were used for this AOP are based on in vitro and in vivo experiments in salmon, quail and newt. At present, it is believed that the function&nbsp;of this neurosteroid differs in mammals, which suggest that this AOP is only applicable to non-mammalian vertebrates. Also, the sex applicability of the AOP varies according to&nbsp;species. &nbsp;

	dcterms:description	"""This AOP details the linkage between CYP7B inhibition and decreased sexual behavior that adversely impacts reproductive success. CYP7B is expressed in the&nbsp;brain and catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone to&nbsp;7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone, a neurosteroid that stimulates the release of dopamine in the telencephalon. When released through this pathway, dopamine binds D2&nbsp;receptor&nbsp;which is involved in induction of sexual behaviors, among other effects.&nbsp;Ketoconazole and other azole fungicides&nbsp;are potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450s, including CYP7B. They bind to the heme site of the enzyme preventing its catalytic activity. When exposed to one of these molecules,&nbsp;7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone synthesis&nbsp;decreases&nbsp;which, in turn, reduces&nbsp;dopamine release in the telencephalon and limits sexual behavior. Since sexual behaviors&nbsp;are closely associated to reproductive success,&nbsp;its inhibition negatively affects the fitness of&nbsp;animals.&nbsp;

	dcterms:description	"""Cyp2E1 is a cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase that bioactivates over 85 substrates, thereby creating electrophilic metabolites and oxidative stress. Substrates are low molecular weight compounds that include acetone, acetaminophen, ethanol, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, furan and molecular oxygen. Mono-oxygenation of these substrates to their reactive metabolites, and the accompanying oxidative stress produced during metabolism, pose health risks because they lead to hepatotoxicity and, often, to liver cancer. Here we describe the AOP for the chronic activation of Cyp2E1 (MIE) leading to liver cancer (AO). The intervening KEs are oxidative stress (KE1), cytotoxicity (KE2), and regenerative proliferation (KE3). These events occur in the liver, which is the primary site of xenobiotic metabolism in the body. Briefly, the MIE occurs when Cyp2E1 binds a substrate. The Cyp2E1 catalytic cycle is prone to decoupling, which produces oxidative stress (KE1), and mono-oxidation of substrates produces reactive metabolites. Both reactive oxygen species and metabolites cause cytotoxicity (KE2). However, following injury, the liver is able to regenerate itself through an increase in cellular proliferation (KE3). Under conditions of chronic activation of Cyp2E1, excessive chronic increases in levels of reactive oxygen species and cell death, and subsequent dysregulated cellular proliferation, leads to tumour formation (AO). We evaluate the essentiality of the KEs and the biological plausibility of and empirical support for the KERs and report that most are well supported by a large body of scientific literature. Here, we&rsquo;ve focused on data generated in rodent studies using the Cyp2E1 substrates carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethanol and furan. These compounds are all liver carcinogens, but generate negative or equivocal results in short-term genotoxicity tests. In fact, they are widely thought to cause cancer through a cytotoxicity and regenerative proliferation mode of action. We expect that the data and information summarized here will be useful to scientists and regulators that are investigating chemical carcinogens that act through this mechanism. Given the importance of oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in a broad array of toxicological effects, the KE(R)s described should be broadly useful for development of other AOPs. Finally, this AOP describes an important widely acknowledged pathway to toxicity and thus should have many regulatory applications. Further development of the quantitative aspects of this AOP will enable the development of more predictive models of effects resulting from oxidative stress.

Nucleoside and nucleotide &nbsp;(nucleos(t)ide) analogs are widely used as antiviral drugs for the effective treatment of viral infections including HIV and chronic Hepatitis B virus infections. As structural analogs of substrate nucleotides, these drugs act as chain terminators of viral DNA synthesis via competitive inhibition of reverse transcriptase or viral DNA polymerases, thereby blocking virus replication. Besides targeting viral enzymes, nucleos(t)ide antiviral agents are also substrates for human DNA polymerases, which may lead to moderate to life-threatening adverse drug reactions, including peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, lactic acidosis, and acute and chronic kidney injury [1-4]. Toxicity of antiviral nucleos(t)ides has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction as a consequence of inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (Pol gamma), a particular sensitive target, and associated inhibition of mtDNA replication [1, 3]. In the kidney, the proximal tubule is the main target of antiviral nucleos(t)ide drug toxicity due to active uptake via basolateral organic anion transporters (e.g. OAT1 and OAT3) expressed at this site [5, 6]. Based on the current mechanistic understanding, the subsequent sequence of key events (KE) leading to kidney injury as an adverse outcome can be described as inhibition of Pol gamma as the molecular initiating event (MIE), leading to mtDNA depletion (KE1), mitochondrial dysfuntion (KE2) and proximal tubule cell toxicity (KE3).

This constitutes a potential public health problem and a challenge to risk assessors and managers as the existing understanding of the pathophysiological processes and the currently available biological tools for prediction of the risk for food allergy development and the severity of the reaction are not sufficient. 

There is a substantial body of in vivo and in vitro data describing molecular and cellular events potentially involved in food sensitization. However, these events have not been organized in a sequence of related events that is plausible to result in sensitization, and useful to challenge current hypotheses.

The aim of this AOP was to collect and structure the current mechanistic understanding of sensitization induction to food proteins by applying the concept of adverse outcome pathway (AOP). 

The proposed AOP for food sensitization is based on information on molecular and cellular mechanisms and pathways evidenced to be involved in sensitization by food and food proteins and uses the AOPs for chemical skin sensitization and respiratory sensitization induction as templates. available mechanistic data on protein respiratory sensitization were included to fill out gaps in the understanding of how proteins may affect cells, cell-cell interactions and tissue homeostasis. Analysis revealed several key events (KE) and biomarkers that may have potential use in testing and assessment of proteins for their sensitizing potential. 

The application of the AOP concept to structure mechanistic in vivo and in vitro knowledge has made it possible to identify methods, each addressing a specific KE, that provide information about the food allergenic potential of new proteins. When applied in the context of an integrated strategy these methods may reduce, if not replace, current animal testing approaches.

	dcterms:description	"""The AOP has two different MIEs: protein adduct formation (MIEa) and CYP2E1 activation (MIEb). Protein adduct formation is the interaction between a chemical, or reactive metabolite, and a protein at molecular level. During this interaction a covalent bond is formed which occurs due to the reaction between an electrophilic chemical and the nucleophilic part of a protein. When a chemical forms a covalent bond with a protein the protein is damaged and can loses its function. Acetaldehyde, the metabolite of ethanol, is also one of these chemicals known to form protein adducts. This is why protein adduct formation is added in this AOP based on ethanol. CYP2E1 is one of the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of ethanol, and because of this metabolic activity the MIE in added in this AOP. CYP2E1 participates in the metabolism of endogenous, small and hydrophobic compounds using a oxidation reaction. CYP2E1 is mainly expressed in rat liver cells, but can also be found in rat brain cells. Furthermore, in the human brain CYP2E1 expression is mainly found in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. At higher concentrations of ethanol the expression of CYP2E1 increases, as well as the activity of CYP2E1 since it has a relatively high Km value for ethanol. In this AOP&nbsp;four different KEs are used, which are oxidative stress (KE1), lipid peroxidation (KE2), unfolded protein response (UPR) (KE3) and apoptosis (KE4). Oxidative stress can be defined as the imbalance between ROS and defence mechanisms against these ROS. ROS levels in a cell can rise which leads to damage by the oxidizing free radicals. Lipid peroxidation is a form of direct damage to lipids in the cell membrane or organelle membranes. The cell membrane will eventually break due to the build-up of all the damage. MDA&nbsp; and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) are two products of lipid peroxidation. UPR is a reaction activated by stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER stress can be induced by too much protein folding which reaches a higher level than the folding capacity. Also accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER and protein adducts formation with important endoplasmic proteins can induce ER stress, which activates UPR. The final KE is apoptosis, which is programmed cell death in general. The process of apoptosis is well regulated and several signal proteins are known to induce the apoptotic process.

	dcterms:description	"""Under physiological conditions complex I (CI) couples the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ by reducing flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to FMNH2. FMNH2 is then oxidized through a semiquinone intermediate. Each electron moves from the FMNH2 to Fe-S clusters, and from the Fe-S clusters to ubiquinone (Q). Transfer of the first electron results in the formation of the free-radical (semiquinone) form of Q, and transfer of the second electron reduces the semiquinone form to the ubiquinol form (CoQH2). Altogether, four protons are translocated from the mitochondrial matrix to the inter-membrane space for each molecule of NADH oxidized at CI. This leads to the establishment of the electrochemical potential difference (proton-motive force) that may be used to produce ATP (Garrett and Grisham, 2010). Binding of an inhibitor attenuates or completely blocks the activity of CI, i.e. the oxidation of NADH is impaired and protons are not moved. This causes two major consequences: first, electrons are channelled toward oxygen instead Q. This impairs normal oxygen reduction into water at complex IV and leads to the formation of the ROS superoxide at other sites of the respiratory chain. Superoxide may cause damage of proteins, lipid and DNA of the cell, or damage components of the mitochondria after transformation into e.g. hydrogen peroxide. These processes result in mitochondrial dysfunction (Voet and Voet., 2008). The second consequence is the increase of the NADH/NAD+ ratio in mitochondria. This affects the function of key dehydrogenase enzymes in the citric acid cycle and can lead to its block, resulting in an inhibition of mitochondrial ATP production and mitochondrial respiration. Prolonged treatment with an inhibitor results in a severe, progressive and irreversible inhibition of complex I, most likely by indirect mechanisms involving oxidative damage (Cleeter et al., 1992). The functional consequences of CI inhibition have been titrated in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Barrientos and Moraes, 1999), with mitochondrial dysfunction measured by a range of different assays (Barrientos and Moraes, 1999; Greenamyre et al., 2001). These included quantification of ROS derived from mitochondria, and of cellular respiration (see KE2: Mitochondrial dysfunction).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""As CI has an enzymatic function as such, but also contributes to the overall function of oxidative phosphorylation, there are two fundamental approaches to assess CI inhibition. The first approach measures the enzymatic activity of the complex itself; the second one assesses the overall activity of oxidative phosphorylation of entire mitochondria, and indirectly infers from this a potential dysfunction of CI.

I. Direct detection of complex I activity. This type of assay is always performed in homogenates of cells or tissues, and requires at least a partial purification of mitochondria or respiratory chain components. In order to focus on CI activity, the activities of Complexes III (e.g. antimycin A) and complex IV (e.g. cyanide) need to be blocked by pharmacological inhibitors in these setups.

1. Forward Electron Transfer. Submitochondrial particles or intact isolated mitochondria are incubated with NADH as electron donor and with an electron acceptor to measure the flow of electrons from NADH, through CI to the acceptor. As readout, either the consumption of NADH, or the reduction of the electron acceptor is followed photometrically or fluorometrically (Lenaz et al. 2004; Spinazzi et al. 2012; Long et al. 2009; Kirby et al. 2007). The physiological electron acceptor of CI is Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Due to its hydrophobicity, it is not suitable for use in an experimental in vitro setup. Short-chain analogs of CoQ10, such as CoQ1 or decylubiquinone (DB) with a 10 carbon-atom linear saturated side chain are hence applied as alternatives. With these non-physiological electron acceptors, it is important to consider that the activity of CI can easily be underestimated. As water-soluble electron acceptors, either ferricyanide or 2,6-dichlorophenolidophenol (DCIP) are used. However the reduction of such compounds is not strictly coupled to the transduction of energy. To identify the portion of rotenone-inhibitable CI activity, all samples investigated are assayed in parallel following treatment with rotenone. In contrast to the autoradiography assays, direct CI activity detection allows the identification also of CI inhibitors that bind to sites of CI different from the rotenone binding site.

2. Reverse Electron Transfer. An alternative setup for the direct measurement of CI activity with minimal interference by the activities of complex III and complex IV make use of the observation of a general reversibility of oxidative phosphorylation and electron flow across the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Ernster et al. 1967). With this method, electrons enter the respiratory chain via complex II. Based on the reverse flux, this method allows the complete circumvention of complexes III and IV. As electron donor, succinate is applied, together with NAD+ as electron acceptor. Formation of NADH from NAD+ can be determined photometrically. The succinate-linked NAD+ reduction can be performed either with intact isolated mitochondria or with submitochondrial particles. For the direct assessment of CI activity, submitochondrial particles are used. For assays with intact mitochondria, the succinate-linked reduction of NAD+ is performed in the presence of ATP as energy source. Potassium cyanide (KCN) is added for inhibition of forward electron transport towards complex IV.

3. Complex I activity dipstick assay. To assess CI activity and its inhibition in cell or tissue homogenates without interference by other components of the respiratory chain, CI-selective antibodies attached to a matrix (e.g. multiwell plates) are used (Willis et al., 2009). Homogenized tissue can directly be added for capturing of CI, the unbound supernatant is washed away and leaves a complex of the antibody and mitochondrial CI. For activity determination, NADH as electron donor and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) as acceptor are added. Reduced NBT forms a colored precipitate, its signal intensity is proportional to the amount of CI bound to the antibody. CI inhibitors can directly be added for an assessment of their inhibitory potential. This method, when applied in e.g. 96-well or 384-well plates, allows screening of large sets of potential CI inhibitors without any interference by other elements of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

II. Indirect measurements of complex I activity. Such assays mostly require / allow the use of live cells.

1. Oxygen consumption. Electrons, fed into the mitochondrial respiratory chain either by CI or complex II, ultimately reduce molecular oxygen to water at complex IV. In a closed system, this consumption of oxygen leads to a drop of the overall O2 concentration, and this can serve as parameter for mitochondrial respiratory activity. Measurements are traditionally done with a Clark electrode, or with more sophisticated optical methods. At the cathode of a Clark electrode, oxygen is electrolytically reduced, which initiates a current in the electrode, causing a potential difference that is ultimately recorded. Clark electrodes however have the disadvantage that oxygen is consumed. Furthermore, interferences with nitrogen oxides, ozone, or chlorine are observed (Stetter et al., 2008). To circumvent these limitations, optical sensors have been developed that have the advantage that no oxygen is consumed, combined with a high accuracy and reversibility. Optical oxygen sensors work according to the principle of dynamic fluorescence quenching. The response of the respective fluorescence dye is proportional to the amount of oxygen in the sample investigated (Wang and Wolfbeis, 2014). In a model of isolated mitochondria in the absence of complex II substrates, oxygen consumption can serve as surrogate readout for the assessment of the degree of CI inhibition. It is however essential to realize that also complex III and complex IV activities are involved and their inhibition also results in a decline in O2 consumption. In addition to that, CI inhibitors can lead to a one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen at the site of CI to yield superoxide. The amount of superoxide formed hence contributes to the consumption of oxygen, but this must not be interpreted as oxygen consumption as a result of controlled and coupled electron flux through the complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. A modern convenient method to measure oxygen consumption is provided by the Seahorse technology of extracellular flux (XF) analysis, in which cells are kept in a very small volume, so that changes of oxygen levels can be detected very sensitively by an oxygen sensor. To allow manipulation of the mitochondria in cells, the cell membrane can be permeabilized with saponin (SAP), digitonin (DIG) or recombinant perfringolysin O (rPFO) (XF-plasma membrane permeabilizer (PMP) reagent), to allow addition of specific substrates to measure activity of different respiratory chain complexes, including CI. (Salabei et al., 2014).

2. Intracellular ATP levels. Intracellular ATP levels originate both from mitochondria and from glycolysis. If glycolytic ATP production is impaired or inhibited, the cellular production of ATP is a measure of mitochondrial function. If it is assumed that the ATP consumption remains constant, then the steady state ATP levels can serve as indirect readout for mitochondrial activity, and the latter depends on the functioning of CI. Inhibitors of CI reduce cellular ATP levels, but it has to be remembered that intracellular ATP levels are also affected by inhibitors of other parts of the respiratory chain, of the citric acid cycle or of the transport of energy substrates. For a proper interpretation of assay results, it has to be ascertained in each particular test system, that ATP production from other sources is excluded and that the cellular ATP consumption remains constant. ATP levels can be easily measured from lysates of in vitro cell cultures or from tissues by a luminometric luciferase/luciferin assay. The amount of light emitted is proportional to the amount of ATP in the sample (Nguyen et al. 1988, Leist et al., 1997).

3. Other approaches. As mitochondrial activity is coupled to many cellular functions, there is a multitude of other indirect assays that are sensitive to inhibitors of CI. Some of these tests may indeed be very sensitive, while they have a low specificity. Thus, their application requires usually a good control of the experimental system and care with the interpretation of the data. One exemplary approach is the measurement of NADH/NAD+ ratios in mitochondria by imaging methods. This provides resolution on the level of individual mitochondria within a living cell (van Vliet et al., 2014).

	dcterms:description	"""Electron transport through the mitochondrial respiratory chain (oxidative phosphorylation) is mediated by five multimeric complexes (I&ndash;V) that are embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane (Fig. 1). NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase is the Complex I (CI) of electron transport chain (ETC). It is a large assembly of proteins that spans the inner mitochondrial membrane. In mammals, it is composed of about 45-47 protein subunits (human 45) of which 7 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, ND5, and ND6) and the remainder by the nuclear genome (Greenamyre, 2001). CI oxidizes NADH elevating the NAD+/NADH ratio by transferring electrons via a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor and several iron-sulfur centers to ubiquinone (Friedrich et al., 1994) (Fig. 1). Binding of an inhibitor to CI inhibits the NADH&ndash;ubiquinone oxido-reductase activity, i.e. blocks the electron transfer. Recent studies suggest that a wide variety of CI inhibitors share a common binding domain at or close to the ubiquinone reduction site (Ino et al., 2003). Furthermore, the structural factors required for inhibitory actions have been characterized on the basis of structure-activity relationships (Miyoshi, 1998, Hideto, 1998). Based on molecular docking simulations, in silico models mimicking the binding of chemicals to the pocket of NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase have been created according to the crystal structure of mitochondrial CI. To investigate the ability of chemicals to bind to the active pocket, around 100 individual docking simulations have been performed. These confirmed the possible site of interaction between the chemical and the pocket of CI. In particular, Miao YJ and coworkers recently investigated the IC50 values of 24 chemicals (annonaceous acetogenins) for inhibition of mitochondrial CI (Miao et al., 2014).

Based on their binding sites, CI inhibitors are classified as follows (Degli Esposti, 1998) (Fig. 2): (i) type A inhibitors are antagonists of fully oxidized ubiquinone binding; (ii) type B inhibitors displace the partially reduced ubisemiquinone intermediate; (iii) type C inhibitors are antagonists of the fully reduced ubiquinol product. The affinity of the different types of CI inhibitors to their diverse CI binding sites is described in the paragraph Evidence for Chemical Initiation of this Molecular Initiating Event (see below) in the context of a specific type of inhibitor.




Fig. 1. The electron transport chain in the mitochondrion. CI (NADH-coenzyme Q reductase or NADH dehydrogenase) accepts electrons from NADH and serves as the link between glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation and the electron transport chain. Complex II also known as succinate-coenzyme Q reductase or succinate dehydrogenase, includes succinate dehydrogenase and serves as a direct link between the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. The coenzyme Q reductase or Complex III transfers the electrons from CoQH2 to reduce cytochrome c which is the substrate for Complex IV (cytochrome c reductase). Complex IV transfers the electrons from cytochrome c to reduce molecular oxygen into water. Finally, this gradient is used by the ATP synthase complex (Complex V) to make ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. mtDNA: mitochondrial DNA; nDNA: nuclear DNA.

""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Two different types of approaches have been used. The first is to measure binding as such, and the corresponding assays are described below; the second is to infer binding indirectly from assays that quantify e.g. CI activity and to assume that the activity can only be altered upon binding. The second type of approach is dealt with in the chapter entitled KE1: Inhibition of NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I). However, it has to be noted here that indirect assays can lead to wrong conclusions. For instance, some compounds may trigger oxidative stress without actually binding to CI. Such compounds, by triggering the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), may damage CI protein components, thus causing a reduction of CI activity.

Measurement of binding by quantitative autoradiography

To assess binding of an inhibitor at the rotenone binding site of CI in tissues (e.g. in the substantia nigra or in the striatum), the standard approach is to quantify the displacement of a radioactively labelled ligand of this binding site by the toxicant under evaluation. Most commonly, binding of [3H]-labeled dihydrorotenone (DHR) is measured and compared in control tissue and treated tissue. Binding of this rotenone-derivative is detected by autoradiography. Unselective binding is determined by measurement of [3H]-DHR binding in the presence of an excess of unlabeled rotenone. Since a rotenone-derivative is used for the assay, only CI inhibitors that bind to the rotenone-binding site in CI are detected. This was observed for e.g., meperdine, amobarbital, or MPP+. This method allows a spatial resolution of CI expression and the mapping of the binding of a competitive inhibitor on CI.

The method can be used for (a) in vitro measurements and for (b) ex vivo measurements:

a) In vitro measurements. Tissues are embedded in a matrix for cutting by a cryostat. The tissue slices are then mounted onto slides. For the binding experiment, they are incubated with the test compound in the presence of labeled [3H]-DHR. Then the tissue slices are washed and prepared for autoradiographic detection (Greenamyre et al. 1992; Higgins and Greenamyre, 1996). b) Ex vivo measurements. As rotenone can pass the blood brain barrier, the in vitro method was further extended for in vivo labeling of CI in the brains of living animals, and detection of binding after preparation of the tissue from such animals. Animals are exposed to test compounds and [3H]-DHR is applied intraventricularly for 2-6 h before the brain is dissected and arranged for the preparation of tissue slices (Talpade et al. 2000). In untreated animals, this method allows a precise spatial resolution of the expression pattern of CI. In animals with impaired CI activity, either as a result of CI deficiencies, or upon treatment with CI inhibitors, the assay allows an assessment of the degree of CI inhibition.

Complex I Enzyme Activity (Colorimetric)

The analysis of mitochondrial OXPHOS CI enzyme activity can be performed using human, rat, mouse and bovine cell and tissue extracts (abcam: http://www.abcam.com/complex-i-enzyme-activity-microplate-assay-kit-colorimetric-ab109721). Capture antibodies specific for CI subunits are pre-coated in the microplate wells. Samples are added to the microplate wells which have been pre-coated with a specific capture antibody. After the target has been immobilized in the well, CI activity is determined by following the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ and the simultaneous reduction of a dye which leads to increased absorbance at OD=450 nm. By analyzing the enzyme&#39;s activity in an isolated context, outside of the cell and free from any other variables, an accurate measurement of the enzyme&#39;s functional state can be evaluated.

	dcterms:description	"""Mitochondrial dysfunction is a consequence of inhibition of the respiratory chain leading to oxidative stress.

Mitochondria can be found in all cells and are considered the most important cellular consumers of oxygen. Furthermore, mitochondria possess numerous redox enzymes capable of transferring single electrons to oxygen, generating the superoxide (O2-). Some mitochondrial enzymes that are involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation include the electron-transport chain (ETC) complexes I, II and III; pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH). The transfer of electrons to oxygen, generating superoxide, happens mainly when these redox carriers are charged enough with electrons and the potential energy for transfer is elevated, like in the case of high mitochondrial membrane potential. In contrast, ROS generation is decreased if there are not enough electrons and the potential energy for the transfer is not sufficient (reviewed in Lin and Beal, 2006).

Cells are also able to detoxify the generated ROS due to an extensive antioxidant defence system that includes superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases, catalase, thioredoxins, and peroxiredoxins in various cell organelles (reviewed in Lin and Beal, 2006). It is worth mentioning that, as in the case of ROS generation, antioxidant defences are also closely related to the redox and energetic status of mitochondria. If mitochondria are structurally and functionally healthy, an antioxidant defence mechanism balances ROS generation, and there is not much available ROS production. However, in case of mitochondrial damage, the antioxidant defence capacity drops and ROS generation takes over. Once this happens, a vicious cycle starts and ROS can further damage mitochondria, leading to more free-radical generation and further loss of antioxidant capacity. During mitochondrial dysfunction the availability of ATP also decreases, which is considered necessary for repair mechanisms after ROS generation.

A number of proteins bound to the mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum (ER), especially in the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM), are playing an important role of communicators between these two organelles (reviewed Mei et al., 2013). ER stress induces mitochondrial dysfunction through regulation of Ca2+ signaling and ROS production (reviewed Mei et al., 2013). Prolonged ER stress leads to release of Ca2+ at the MAM and increased Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondrial matrix, which induces Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. At the same, ROS are produced by proteins in the ER oxidoreductin 1 (ERO1) family. ER stress activates ERO1 and leads to excessive production of ROS, which, in turn, inactivates SERCA and activates inositol-1,4,5- trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) via oxidation, resulting in elevated levels of cytosolic Ca2+, increased mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+, and ultimately mitochondrial dysfunction. Just as ER stress can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction also induces ER Stress (reviewed Mei et al., 2013). For example, nitric oxide disrupts the mitochondrial respiratory chain and causes changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ flux which induce ER stress. Increased Ca2+ flux triggers loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), release of cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), decreasing ATP synthesis and rendering the cells more vulnerable to both apoptosis and necrosis (Wang and Qin, 2010).

Summing up: Mitochondria play a pivotal role in cell survival and cell death because they are regulators of both energy metabolism and apoptotic/necrotic pathways (Fiskum, 2000; Wieloch, 2001; Friberg and Wieloch, 2002). The production of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation is a vital mitochondrial function (Kann and Kov&aacute;cs, 2007; Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012). The ATP is continuously required for signalling processes (e.g. Ca2+ signalling), maintenance of ionic gradients across membranes, and biosynthetic processes (e.g. protein synthesis, heme synthesis or lipid and phospholipid metabolism) (Kang and Pervaiz, 2012), and (Green, 1998; McBride et al., 2006). Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration contributes to various cellular stress responses, such as deregulation of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis (Graier et al., 2007) and ROS production (Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012; reviewed Mei et al., 2013).). It is well established in the existing literature that mitochondrial dysfunction may result in: (a) an increased ROS production and a decreased ATP level, (b) the loss of mitochondrial protein import and protein biosynthesis, (c) the reduced activities of enzymes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the Krebs cycle, (d) the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, (e) the loss of mitochondrial motility, causing a failure to re-localize to the sites with increased energy demands (f) the destruction of the mitochondrial network, and (g) increased mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, causing Ca2+ overload (reviewed in Lin and Beal, 2006; Graier et al., 2007), (h) the rupture of the mitochondrial inner and outer membranes, leading to (i) the release of mitochondrial pro-death factors, including cytochrome c (Cyt. c), apoptosis-inducing factor, or endonuclease G (Braun, 2012; Martin, 2011; Correia et al., 2012; Cozzolino et al., 2013), which eventually leads to apoptotic, necrotic or autophagic cell death (Wang and Qin, 2010). Due to their structural and functional complexity, mitochondria present multiple targets for various compounds.

	mmo:0000000	"""Mitochondrial dysfunction can be detected using isolated mitochondria, intact cells or cells in culture as well as in vivo studies. Such assessment can be performed with a large range of methods (revised by Brand and Nicholls, 2011) for which some important examples are given. All approaches to assess mitochondrial dysfunction fall into two main categories: the first assesses the consequences of a loss-of-function, i.e. impaired functioning of the respiratory chain and processes linked to it. Some assay to assess this have been described for KE1, with the limitation that they are not specific for complex I. In the context of overall mitochondrial dysfunction, the same assays provide useful information, when performed under slightly different assay conditions (e.g. without addition of complex III and IV inhibitors). The second approach assesses a &lsquo;non-desirable gain-of-function&rsquo;, i.e. processes that are usually only present to a very small degree in healthy cells, and that are triggered in a cell, in which mitochondria fail.

I. Mitochondrial dysfunction assays assessing a loss-of function.

1. Cellular oxygen consumption.

See KE1 for details of oxygen consumption assays. The oxygen consumption parameter can be combined with other endpoints to derive more specific information on the efficacy of mitochondrial function. One approach measures the ADP-to-O ratio (the number of ADP molecules phosphorylated per oxygen atom reduced (Hinkle, 1995 and Hafner et al., 1990). The related P/O ratio is calculated from the amount of ADP added, divided by the amount of O2 consumed while phosphorylating the added ADP (Ciapaite et al., 2005; Diepart et al., 2010; Hynes et al., 2006; James et al., 1995; von Heimburg et al., 2005).

2. Mitochondrial membrane potential (&Delta;&psi;m ).

The mitochondrial membrane potential (&Delta;&psi;m) is the electric potential difference across the inner mitochondrial membrane. It requires a functioning respiratory chain in the absence of mechanisms that dissipate the proton gradient without coupling it to ATP production. The classical, and still most quantitative method uses a tetraphenylphosphonium ion (TPP+)-sensitive electrode on suspensions of isolated mitochondria. The &Delta;&psi;m can also be measured in live cells by fluorimetric methods. These are based on dyes which accumulate in mitochochondria because of &Delta;&psi;m. Frequently used are tetramethylrhodamineethylester (TMRE), tetramethylrhodaminemethyl ester (TMRM) (Petronilli et al., 1999) or 5,5&prime;,6,6&prime;-tetrachloro-1,1&prime;,3,3&prime;-tetraethylbenzimidazole carbocyanide iodide (JC-1). Mitochondria with intact membrane potential concentrate JC-1, so that it forms red fluorescent aggregates, whereas de-energized mitochondria cannot concentrate JC-1 and the dilute dye fluoresces green (Barrientos et al., 1999). Assays using TMRE or TMRM measure only at one wavelength (red fluorescence), and depending on the assay setup, de-energized mitochondria become either less fluorescent (loss of the dye) or more fluorescent (attenuated dye quenching).

3. Enzymatic activity of the electron transport system (ETS).

Determination of ETS activity can be dene&nbsp;following Owens and King&#39;s assay (1975). The technique is based on a cell-free homogenate that is incubated with NADH to saturate the mitochondrial ETS and an artificial electron acceptor [l - (4 -iodophenyl) -3 - (4 -nitrophenyl) -5-phenylte trazolium chloride (INT)] to register the electron transmission rate. The oxygen consumption rate is calculated from the molar production rate of INT-formazan which is determined spectrophotometrically (Cammen et al., 1990).

4. ATP content.

For the evaluation of ATP levels, various commercially-available ATP assay kits are offered &nbsp;based on luciferin and luciferase activity. For isolated mitochondria various methods are available to continuously measure ATP with electrodes (Laudet 2005), with luminometric methods, or for obtaining more information on different nucleotide phosphate pools (e.g. Ciapaite et al., (2005).


II. Mitochondrial dysfunction assays assessing a gain-of function.


1. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening (PTP).

The opening of the PTP is associated with a permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes, so that different compounds and cellular constituents can change intracellular localization. This can be measured by assessment of the translocation of cytochrome c, adenylate kinase or AIF from mitochondria to the cytosol or nucleus. The translocation can be assessed biochemically in cell fractions, by imaging approaches in fixed cells or tissues or by life-cell imaging of GFP fusion proteins (Single 1998; Modjtahedi 2006). An alternative approach is to measure the accessibility of cobalt to the mitochondrial matrix in a calcein fluorescence quenching assay in live permeabilized cells (Petronilli et al., 1999).

2. mtDNA damage as a biomarker of mitochondrial dysfunction.

Various quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR)-based assays have been developed to detect changes of DNA structure and sequence in the mitochondrial genome. mtDNA damage can be detected in blood after low-level rotenone exposure, and the damage persists even after CI activity has returned to normal. With a more sustained rotenone exposure, mtDNA damage is also detected in skeletal muscle. These data support the idea that mtDNA damage in peripheral tissues in the rotenone model may provide a biomarker of past or ongoing mitochondrial toxin exposure (Sanders et al., 2014a and 2014b).

3. Generation of ROS and resultant oxidative stress.

a. General approach. Electrons from the mitochondrial ETS may be transferred &lsquo;erroneously&rsquo; to molecular oxygen to form superoxide anions. This type of side reaction can be strongly enhanced upon mitochondrial damage. As superoxide may form hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals or other reactive oxygen species, a large number of direct ROS assays and assays assessing the effects of ROS (indirect ROS assays) are available (Adam-Vizi, 2005; Fan and Li 2014). Direct assays are based on the chemical modification of fluorescent or luminescent reporters by ROS species. Indirect assays assess cellular metabolites, the concentration of which is changed in the presence of ROS (e.g. glutathione, malonaldehyde, isoprostanes,etc.) At the animal level the effects of oxidative stress are measured from biomarkers in the blood or urine.

b. Measurement of the cellular glutathione (GSH) status. GSH is regenerated from its oxidized form (GSSH) by the action of an NADPH dependent reductase (GSSH + NADPH + H+ &agrave; 2 GSH + NADP+). The ratio of GSH/GSSG is therefore a good indicator for the cellular NADH+/NADPH ratio (i.e. the redox potential). GSH and GSSH levels can be determined by HPLC, capillary electrophoresis, or biochemically with DTNB (Ellman&rsquo;s reagent). As excess GSSG is rapidly exported from most cells to maintain a constant GSH/GSSG ratio, a reduction of total glutathione (GSH/GSSG) is often a good surrogate measure for oxidative stress.

c. Quantification of lipid peroxidation. Measurement of lipid peroxidation has historically relied on the detection of thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive compounds such as malondialdehyde generated from the decomposition of cellular membrane lipid under oxidative stress (Pryor et al., 1976). This method is quite sensitive, but not highly specific. A number of commercial assay kits are available for this assay using absorbance or fluorescence detection technologies. The formation of F2-like prostanoid derivatives of arachidonic acid, termed F2-isoprostanes (IsoP) has been shown to be more specific for lipid peroxidation. A number of commercial ELISA kits have been developed for IsoPs, but interfering agents in samples requires partial purification before analysis. Alternatively, GC/MS may be used, as robust (specific) and sensitive method.


d. Detection of superoxide production. Generation of superoxide by inhibition of complex I and the methods for its detection are described by Grivennikova and Vinogradov (2014). A range of different methods is also described by BioTek (http://www.biotek.com/resources/articles/reactive-oxygen-species.html). The reduction of ferricytochrome c to ferrocytochrome c may be used to assess the rate of superoxide formation (McCord, 1968). Like in other superoxide assays, specificity can only be obtained by measurements in the&nbsp;absence and presence of superoxide dismutase. Chemiluminescent reactions have been used for their increased sensitivity. The most widely used chemiluminescent substrate is lucigenin. Coelenterazine has also been used as a chemiluminescent substrate. Hydrocyanine dyes are fluorogenic sensors for superoxide and hydroxyl radical, and they become membrane impermeable after oxidation (trapping at site of formation). The best characterized of these probes are Hydro-Cy3 and Hydro-Cy5. generation of superoxide in mitochondria can be visualized using fluorescence microscopy with MitoSOX&trade; Red reagent (Life Technologies). MitoSOX&trade; Red reagent is a cationic derivative of dihydroethidium that permeates live cells and accumulates in mitochondria.

e. Detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. There are a number of fluorogenic substrates, which serve as hydrogen donors that have been used in conjunction with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme to produce intensely fluorescent products in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (Zhou et al., 1997: Ruch et al., 1983). The more commonly used substrates include diacetyldichloro-fluorescein, homovanillic acid, and Amplex&reg; Red. In these examples, increasing amounts of H2O2 form increasing amounts of fluorescent product (Tarpley et al., 2004).

Summing up, mitochondrial dysfunction can be measured by: &bull; ROS production: superoxide (O2-), and hydroxyl radicals (OH&minus;) &bull; Nitrosative radical formation such as ONOO&minus; or directly by: &bull; Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) &bull; Opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTP) &bull; ATP synthesis &bull; Increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ &bull; Cytochrome c release &bull; AIF (apoptosis inducing factor) release from mitochondria &bull; Mitochondrial Complexes enzyme activity &bull; Measurements of mitochondrial oxygen consumption &bull; Ultrastructure of mitochondria using electron microscope and mitochondrial fragmentation measured by labelling with DsRed-Mito expression (Knott et al, 2008) Mitochondrial dysfunction-induced oxidative stress can be measured by: &bull; Reactive carbonyls formations (proteins oxidation) &bull; Increased 8-oxo-dG immunoreactivity (DNA oxidation) &bull; Lipid peroxidation (formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4- hydroxynonenal (HNE) &bull; 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) formation, marker of protein nitration &bull; Translocation of Bid and Bax to mitochondria &bull; Measurement of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i): Cells are loaded with 4 &mu;M fura-2/AM). &bull; Ratio between reduced and oxidized form of glutathione (GSH depletion) (Promega assay, TB369; Radkowsky et al., 1986) &bull; Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activation that is Ca2+-dependent. All above measurements can be performed as the assays for each readout are well established in the existing literature (e.g. Bal-Price and Brown, 2000; Bal-Price et al., 2002; Fujikawa, 2015; Walker et al., 1995).

	dcterms:alternative	"Impaired, Proteostasis" ;
	dc:source	"AOPWiki" ;
	dcterms:description	"""The concept of proteostasis refers to the homeostasis of proteins in space and time, i.e. the correct balance between protein synthesis, modification, transport and degradation. Disturbance of proteostasis results in pathological changes either by loss of function events (lack of a pivotal protein/protein function) or by a gain of undesired functions (aggregation of a protein leading to the formation of inclusions and new structures in cells and disturbing turnover of many unrelated proteins).

Proteostasis regulation is the main defence mechanism against toxic proteins, whose accumulation could greatly compromise normal cellular function and viability. Therefore, the chaperone and degradation systems assuring the removal of misfolded and aggregated proteins, as well as damaged, dysfunctional cellular organelles (e.g. defective mitochondria) play a key role in cellular homeostasis (Lee et al., 2012). The two major degradation systems are the ubiquitin&ndash;proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy&ndash;lysosome pathway (ALP) (Korolchuk et al., 2010; Kroemer et al., 2010; Ravikumar et al., 2010). The UPS works through the attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules to a protein substrate, followed by the subsequent degradation of the tagged polyubiquitinated protein by the proteasome (Ciechanover, 1998; Ciechanover and Brundin, 2003). A compromised function of the UPS leads to the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins, such as &alpha;-synuclein&nbsp;(Ii et al. 1997; Spillantini et al. 1997; Sulzer and Zecca 2000). The accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, as a consequence of a dysfunctional proteasome activity, is observed in some pathologies, and experimental inhibition of the proteasome has been shown to trigger parkinsonian neurodegeneration (McNaught and Jenner 2001; Hardy et al., 2001).

ALP involves the engulfment of cytoplasmic materials into autophagosomes, which are degraded by lysosomal enzymes after fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (Kuma et al., 2004) or direct import of proteins into lysosomes (Cuervo, 2004; Mizushima et al., 2008). Autophagy also plays an essential role for the removal of damaged organelles, such as mitochondria. Both, excessive autophagy or reduced autophagic flux can compromise cell survival (Rothermel and Hill, 2007), and several genetic forms of PD are linked to the autophagy-related genes Pink1, Parkin or Uchl1. Autophagy enables cell survival during mitochondrial stress by clearing the damaged organelles (Lee et al., 2012).

One of the main aggregated proteins found to accumulate in nigrostriatal cells during Parkinson&#39;s disease is &alpha;-synuclein. Aggregation of &alpha;-synuclein can obstruct normal cellular transport, leading to impaired intracellular trafficking and/or trapping of cellular organelles in inappropriate locations, this resulting in synaptic and cell dysfunctions (Bartels et al., 2011) (Bellucci A., et al., 2012; Cookson MR., 2005; Games D.,&nbsp;et al., 2013; Hunn BH., et al., 2015). Importantly, accumulation of &alpha;-synuclein affects mitochondrial trafficking. The polarity and correct function of different types of cells depend on an efficient transport of mitochondria to areas of high energy consumption (Sheng, 2014). Therefore, the correct distribution of mitochondria to various parts of a cell is essential to preserve cell function (Schwarz, 2013; Zhu et al., 2012).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""1. Evaluation of UPS function. General turnover assays: quantitative evaluation can be based on the detection of increased ubiquitin or ubiquinated proteins, as well as proteasomal subunits, either by immunocyto/histochemistry or by western blotting (Rideout et al., 2001; Ortega and Lucas, 2014). UPS activity can be continuously monitored by quantitating (by mean of flow cytometry or microscopy) the level of e.g. EGFP-degron fusion proteins (green fluorescent protein) that are selectively degraded by the proteasome (Bence et al., 2001).

Proteasome activity assay. Various fluorogenic substrates (e.g., Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC for the chymotrypsin-like activity) can be used for the determination of proteasomal activity in in vivo or in vitro applications. These substrates may be applied to tissue or cell homogenates, but specific measurements require partial purification of the proteasome (Kisselev and Goldberg, 2005).

Detection of &alpha;-synuclein (AS) aggregates. The most common methods to detect AS aggregates use immunostaining for AS (in cells or in tissues). In cell culture, AS may also be epitope-tagged or coupled to GFP to allow an indirect detection. The detection of small, not microscopically-visible AS aggregates is indicative of protease-resistance. Tissue slices may be exposed to proteases before immunostaining for AS. Alternatively, small or large aggregates may be biochemically enriched by differential centrifugation and proteolytic treatment, and then analyzed, e.g., by western blot, mass spectrometry or ELISA-like immunoquantification.

2. Evaluation of ALP function.

Quantification of lysosomes or autophagosomes. Disturbances of ALP often result in counter-regulations that can be visualized by staining of lysosomes or parts of the autophagy system. Several weakly basic dyes can be used to stain acidic organelles (lysosomes) in live cells. For example, the dye LysoTracker Red stains lysosomes and can be used to monitor autophagy (Klionsky et al., 2007; Klionsky et al., 2008). The autofluorescent drug monodansylcadaverine (MDC) has also been used as autophago-lysosome marker (Munaf&oacute; and Colombo, 2002). A convenient way to stain lysosomes in tissue or fixed cells is the use of antibodies against the Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP-1) (Rajapakshe et al., 2015) or against cathepsins (Foghsgaard et al., 2001). For qualitative or semiquantitative estimates of lysosomes and related organelles, transmission electron microscopy has been frequently used (Barth et al., 2010).

Monitoring of autophagy-related molecules. The amount and the localization of autophagy-related proteins can change during disturbance of the ALP. Especially in cell culture, but also in transgenic mice, various techniques have been used to monitor autophagy by mean of fluorescence-tags or other substrates, e.g., ATG, autophagy-related protein or autophagy substrates, to monitor their fate in cells and thus provide information on disturbed ALP, or the over-expression of GFP&ndash;LC3, in which GFP (green fluorescent protein) is expressed as a fusion protein at the amino terminus of LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3), which is the a mammalian homologue of S. cerevisiae ATG8 (Kadowaki and Karim, 2009).

Monitoring autophagic flux. The lysosomal degradation of the autophagic cargo constitutes the autophagic flux, which can be measured by assessing the rate of turnover of long-lived proteins that are normally turned over by autophagy (Bauvy et al., 2009). This is performed by labelling intracellular proteins with either [14C]-leucine or [14C]-valine, followed by a long culture period in standard medium. The release of radioactive leucin or valin into the culture medium corresponds to the protein degradation rate in cells, and it may be measured by liquid scintillation counting.

Monitoring the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. The progression of autophagy (autophagic flux) can be studied by the conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II (i.e. a post-translational modification specific for autophagy) by mean of Western blot analysis. The amount of LC3-II correlates with the number of autophagosomes. Conversion of LC3 can be used to examine autophagic activity in the presence or absence of lysosomal activity (Klionsky et al., 2007; Klionsky et al., 2008). The technology can also be used in vivo, e.g. by the use of transgenic mice that overexpress GFP&ndash;LC3 (Kuma et al., 2004).

3. Evaluation of intracellular transport of mitochondria and other organelles.

A range of technologies has been used to visualize mitochondrial dynamics in live cells (Jakobs, 2006; Grafstein and Forman, 1980). They usually employ a combination of mitochondrial labelling with fluorescent dyes (e.g. DiOC6 (3, 3&prime;-Dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide), JC-1 (5,5&prime;,6,6&prime;-Tetrachloro-1,1&prime;,3,3&prime; tetraethylbenzimida-zolylcarbo-cyanine iodide), MitoTracker, MitoFluor probes, etc.), followed by video- or confocal microscopy for live cell imaging (Schwarz, 2013; Pool et al., 2006). Most frequently, mitochondrial mobility is observed along neurites, and measurable endpoints may be mitochondrial speed and direction with regard to the cell soma (Schildknecht et al. 2013). Additionally, also mitochondrial fusion and fission have been monitored by such methods (Exner et al., 2012). The transport of other organelles along neurites may be monitored using similar methods, and the microtubule structures that serve as transport scaffold may be co-stained.

	dcterms:alternative	"N/A, Neuroinflammation" ;
	dc:source	"AOPWiki" ;
	dcterms:description	"""Neuroinflammation or brain inflammation differs from peripheral inflammation in that the vascular response and the role of peripheral bone marrow-derived cells are less conspicuous. The most easily detectable feature of neuroinflammation is activation of microglial cells and astrocytes. It is evidenced by changes in shape, increased expression of certain antigens, and accumulation and proliferation of the glial cells in affected regions (Aschner, 1998; Graeber &amp; Streit, 1990; Monnet-Tschudi et al, 2007; Streit et al, 1999; Kraft and Harry, 2011; Claycomb et al., 2013). Upon stimulation by cytokines or inflammogens (e.g. from pathogens or from damaged neurons), both glial cell types activate inflammatory signalling pathways, which result in increased expression and/or release of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, eicosanoids, and metalloproteinases (Dong &amp; Benveniste, 2001), as well as in the production of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) (Brown &amp; Bal-Price, 2003). Different types of activation states are possible for microglia and astrocytes, resulting in pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory signalling and other cellular functions (such as phagocytosis) (Streit et al., 1999; Nakajima and Kohsaka, 2004).

Therefore, neuroinflammation can have both neuroprotective/neuroreparative and neurodegenerative consequences (Carson et al., 2006&nbsp;; Monnet-Tschudi et al, 2007; Aguzzi et al., 2013&nbsp;; Glass et al., 2010). Under normal physiological conditions, microglial cells scan the nervous system for neuronal integrity (Nimmerjahn et al, 2005) and for invading pathogens (Aloisi, 2001; Kreutzberg, 1995; Kreutzberg, 1996; Rivest, 2009). They are the first type of cell activated (first line of defence), and can subsequently induce astrocyte activation (Falsig, 2008). Two distinct states of microglial activation have been described (Gordon, 2003; Kigerl et al, 2009; Maresz et al, 2008; Mosser &amp; Edwards, 2008; Perego et al; Ponomarev et al, 2005): The M1 state is classically triggered by interferon-gamma and/or other pro-inflammatory cytokines, and this state is characterized by increased expression of integrin alpha M (Itgam) and CD86, as well as the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6), and it is mostly associated with neurodegeneration. The M2 state is triggered by IL-4 and IL-13 (Maresz et al, 2008; Perego et al, 2011; Ponomarev et al, 2007) and induces the expression of mannose receptor 1 (MRC1), arginase1 (Arg 1) and Ym1/2; it is involved in repair processes. The activation of astrocytes by microglia-derived cytokines or TLR agonists resembles the microglial M1 state (Falsig 2006). Although classification of the M1/M2 polarization of microglial cells may be considered as a simplification of authentic microglial reaction states (Ransohoff, 2016), a similar polarization of reactive astrocytes has been descibed recently Liddlelow et al., 2017): Interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1alpha), TNF and subcomponent q (C1q) released by activated microglial cells induce A1-reactive astrocytes, which lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis and induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes.
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Neuroinflammation, i.e. the activation of glial cells can be measured by quantification of cellular markers (most commonly), or of released mediators (less common). As multiple activation states exist for the two main cell types involved, it is necessary to measure several markers of neuroinflammation:


	Microglial activation can be detected based on the increased numbers of labeled microglia per volume element of brain tissue (due to increase of binding sites, proliferation, and immigration of cells) or on morphological changes. A specific microglial marker, used across different species, is CD11b. Alternatively various specific carbohydrate structures can be stained by lectins (e.g. IB4). Beyond that, various well-established antibodies are available to detect microglia in mouse tissue (F4/80), phagocytic microglia in rat tissue (ED1) or more generally microglia across species (Iba1). Transgenic mice are available with fluorescent proteins under the control of the CD11b promoter to easily quantify microglia without the need for specific stains.
	The most frequently used astrocyte marker is GFAP (99% of all studies) (Eng et al., 2000). This protein is highly specific for astrocytes in the brain, and antibodies are available for immunocytochemical detection. In neuroinflammatory brain regions, the stain becomes more prominent, due to an upregulation of the protein, a shape change/proliferation of the cells, and/or better accessibility of the antibody. Various histological quantification approaches can be used. Occasionally, alternative astrocytic markers, such as vimentin of the S100beta protein, have been used for staining of astrocytes (Struzynska et al., 2007). Antibodies for complement component 3 (C3), the most characteristic and highly upregulated marker of A1 neurotoxic reactive astrocytes are commercially available.
	All immunocytochemical methods can also be applied to cell culture models.
	In patients, microglial accumulation can be monitored by PET imaging, using [11C]-PK 11195 as a microglial marker (Banati et al., 2002).
	Activation of glial cells can be assessed in tissue or cell culture models also by quantification of sets of activation markers. This can for instance be done by PCR quantification of inflammatory factors, by measurement of the respective mediators, e.g. by ELISA-related immuno-quantification. Such markers include:



	Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-1&beta;; TNF-&alpha;, Il-6, IL-4); or expression of immunostimmulatory proteins (e.g. MHC-II)
	Itgam, CD86 expression as markers of M1 microglial phenotype
	Arg1, MRC1, as markers of M2 microglial phenotype

	dcterms:description	"""Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (DA neurons) within the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) i.e. the nigrostriatal pathway, paralleled by the formation of cytoplasmic fibrillar inclusions called Lewy bodies (LB), is regarded as a key event in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) and is, in a quantitative manner, directly linked to the occurrence of clinical signs indicative of PD, i.e impaired motor behavior (Shulman et al., 2011; Jellinger et al., 2009, Dickinson 2012, Dauer et al., 2003). The severity of the clinical signs correlates with the degree of nigral cell loss, and the reduced level of dopamine in the striatum. It is estimated that at the onset of clinical signs, 60% of SNpc neurons are lost, corresponding to an 80% depletion of striatal dopamine (Jellinger et al., 2009). PD is clinically and pathologically defined as a progressive disorder: there is a temporally progress, according to a specific pattern, from the brain stem to the nigrostriatal areas and to cortical locations (Braak et al., 2004 and 2009) and there is a temporal increase in the occurrence of LB, of dopamine depletion in the striatum and of loss of DA neurons in the SNpc (Shulman et al., 2012). Indeed, in patients with PD there is a more evident loss of dopamine in striatum compared to SNpc, indicating that striatal dopaminergic nerve terminals are the primary target of the degenerative process in the nigrostriatal pathway and that neuronal loss in SNpc would result as a final outcome (Hornykiewicz et al., 1966; Dauer et al.,&nbsp;2003; Bernhaimer et al., 1973; Pavese&nbsp;et al., 2009). Studies in PD patients and experimental models are also suggesting that progression from striatal terminal to loss of DA neurons occurs through a &ldquo;dying back&rdquo; axonopathy pathology and that axonal dysfuction may be an important hallmark in PD (Orimo et al., 2005; Raff et&nbsp;al., 2002; Kim-Han et al., 2011; O&rsquo;Malley 2010).

In human brain, the classical Lewy body (LB) is characterized at light microscopy by eosinophilic, spherical, intra-cytoplasmatic inclusion and it stains for &alpha;-synuclein and ubiqutin proteins which form the ultrastructural fibrillar core of LB visible at transmission electron microscopy. On autopsy, from individuals affected by PD, accumulation of aggregates positive for &alpha;-synuclein protein are also observed within neuronal processes, called Lewy neurites (LN), as well as by neurons showing a more diffuse or granular peri-nuclear pattern (Dickson 2012). Because dopaminergic cells are rich in melanin, their loss is detectable by depigmentation of the midbrain at gross pathology examination (Dickson 2012; Shulman et al., 2010). However, it should be noted that, although LB are recognized as characteristic of PD, they are not found in a minority of clinically defined PD cases (Dauer 2003) and they can also be observed in other diseases (Dickson 2012).

The biological function of the nigrostriatal pathway depends on the intactness of its anatomical structure. Preservation of the striatum terminals and of neuronal cell bodies of DA neurons in the SNpc is a prerequisite for the maintenance of the physiological function (Fujita et al., 2014). The nigrostriatal system is anatomically located in the basal ganglia loop which comprises the motor system structures caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidum and subsatantia nigra. The caudate nucleus and the putamen are collectively called striatum (David Robinson in: Neurobiology, Springer edition, 1997). The system plays a unique integrative role in the control of movement as part of a system called the &ldquo;basal ganglia motor loop&rdquo;. This anatomical loop includes structures in the thalamus, motor and somatosensory cortex and wide regions of surrounding cortex. Neurons of the SN produce dopamine ( DA) and project to the striatum. They give dopaminergic excitatory (D1 receptors) and inhibitory (D2 receptors) inputs to striatal interneurons (GABAergic). These control thalamic output to the motor cortex. Degeneration within the SNpc leads to a decreased thalamic activation of the motor cortex. (Shulman et al., 2011).

The dopaminergic cells localized in the SNpc synthesize the transmitter substance dopamine (DA) and make extensive contacts within the caudate and putamen (the striatum). These DA neurons have a complex morphology and high energy demand. They are provided with very long and dense arborisations projecting into the striatum where DA is released. This unique morphological characteristics demand a high level of energy to maintain the activity at the synaptic level, to compensate for the risk of depolarization of the poorly myelinated fibres and to support a long distance axonal transport. This puts a tremendous burden on mitochondrial functions (Pissadaki et al., 2013). SNpc neurons are provided with specific calcium channels, the L-type Cav 1.3 which are intended to regulate the autonomous firing as &ldquo;pacemaker&rdquo;. The high demand of calcium buffering arising from this is handled by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and by the mitochondria. This is a function specific for SNpc DA neurons, as the dopaminergic neurons belonging to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are using Na+ channels as a pacemaker. Additional peculiarities of the neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway are the high number of synapses and the higher probability of these neurons to accumulate misfolded proteins, including &alpha;-synuclein. Furthermore, the nigrostriatal pathway metabolism of DA is known to induce oxidative and nitrative stress (Fujita et al., 2014; Asanuma et al., 2003; Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2003; Pissadaki et al., 2013) making DA neurons particularly sensitive to oxidative stress (Lotharius and Brundin, 2002). DA neurons in SNpc also have a relatively low mitochondria mass which may contribute to the vulnerability of these neurons (Liang et al., 2007). In addition, increased levels of iron have been observed in SN of PD patients (Gotz et al., 2004) and the high content of iron in dopamine neurons has been reported to trigger oxidative/nitrosative stress and subsequent neurodegeneration (Ayton and Lei 2014; Benshachar et al., 1991). As a consequence, these neurons are particularly sensitive to various stressors that can contribute to their vulnerability and preferential loss (Fujita et al., 2014).

	mmo:0000000	"""The presence of DA cells in the SNpc and DA terminals in the striatum can be visualized using different phenotypic histological markers. Changes can be captured by measurement of markers specific for dopaminergic neurons such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH),dopamine transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2). Degenerating and/or degenerated neurons can be detected by the silver stains and the Fluoro Jade stains.&nbsp;Depending on the chemical stressor, study design and animal species/strain, the methodology required for the analysis of neuropathology and function may vary as it is recognized that different endpoints can be quantitatively and/or qualitatively affected differently. However, when testing potential neurotoxic chemicals, it is important to assess the integrity and function of the nigra-striatal pathway. Some well-developed and accepted techniques such as quantification of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra par compacta, quantification of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum, quantification of dopamine content in the striatum and detection of Lewy Body-like aggregation, which are commonly used for these purposes, are described below (Tieu, 2011):&nbsp;&nbsp;

&bull; The silver degeneration stain is a method to trace degeneration of axons. By this matter, products from disintegrated cells are visualized (Switzer R., 2000; Betarbet et al., 2000). The mechanism by which the siver degeneration stain labels degenerating neurons is unknown.

&bull; Fluoro Jade stain is a fluorochrome derived from fluorescein used in neuroscience disciplines to label degenerating neurons. It is an alternative technique to traditional methods for labeling degenerating neurons such as silver degeneration staining. Fluoro-Jade may be preferred to other degeneration stains due to the simplicity of staining procedures, which are a common drawbacks of conventional stains. However, the mechanism by which fluoro-jade labels degenerating neurons is unknown (Betarbet et al., 2000, Schmued et al., 1997).

&bull; Detection of TH, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of the amino acid L-tyrosine to L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a precursor for dopamine. Detection of TH can be done either by immunocytochemistry followed by cell counting (quantitative evaluation) or by western blot followed by densitometry analysis (Betarbet et al., 2000, Lee 1987, Fetissov 1999).

&bull; Counting of cells, immunostained for TH, or counting of nuclei by e.g. with Nissel&rsquo;s, DAPI (Kapuscinski, 1995) or Hoechst stain (Latt et al., 1976) should be done following standard morphometric protocols. However, inclusion of stereological cell counts to assess neurodegeneration is representing the most sensitive method to confirm quantitatively specific morphological changes (Dauer 2008, Brooks 1992, Thiruchelvam 2000a and 2000b).

&bull; Quantification of dopaminergic neurons in SNpc: the average number of DA neurons in adult mouse SN is approximately 8.000 to 14.000, depending on strain (Zaborszky and Vadasz 2001). Their distribution is not homogeneous with difference in density between the caudal and rostral part of the SN. The gold standard for counting neurons is then to use an unbiased stereological protocol for cell counting with an optical dissector system (Tieu et al., 2011). This requires a computerized stereology software. The count should include TH+ neurons as well the total count of neurons using a non-specific cell stain (e.g. Nisell&rsquo;s, Fox3).

&bull; Quantification of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum: the density of dopaminergic terminals is not homogeneous in the striatum, increasing from the rostral to the caudal part and representative regions of the striatum should be assessed. This can be done by digitalization of the fibres and quantification by optical density or quantification of the fiber density identifyied by by TH+ immunoreactivity (Tieu et al., 2011; Fernagut et al., 2007). Alternatively, striatal tissue can be isolated for immunobloting of TH or DAT.

&bull; DA transporters (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) can be visualized and quantified using immunocytochemistry (single cell levels) or western blot followed by densitometry analysis, to quantify the changes in their expression. (Hirata et al., 2007; Fornai et al., 2003; Tong et al., 2011; Ciliax et al., 1995). &bull; DA, DOPAC (DA metabolite) and homovanillic&nbsp;acid (HVA) content in the striatum can be quantified through several methodologies such as capillary electrophoresis, spectrofluorimetry and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The commonly used detectors for chromatography include MS, UV, optical fiber detector, electrochemical detector and fluorescence detector (Zhao et al., 2011, Fornai et al., 2005, Magnusson et al., 1980). &bull; Indentification of LB in standard histological sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin, they are characterized by the presence of pale eosinophilic vacuoles (Betarbet et al., 2000 and 2006; Pappolla et al., 1988; Dale et al., 1992).

&bull; Immuno staining for &alpha;-synuclein and ubiquitin to identify and quantify Lewy bodies presence. In vivo, &alpha;-synuclein and ubiqutin can be evaluated in the fixed tissue and quantified for fluorescence intensity (Betarbet et al., 2000 and 2006; Forno et al., 1996, Tiller-Borcich 1988; Galloway et al., 199;, Kuzuhara et al., 1988; Kuusisto eyt al., 2003).

&bull; Imaging techniques: 18-fluoro-dopa positron emission tomography (PET) quantification of various dopamine presynaptic markers (e.g. dopamine transporter DAT, vescicular monoamine transporter type 2 VAT2) identified by single photon emission tomography (SPECT). They permit to visualize the loss of nigrostriatal DA neurons in patients(Shapira et al. 2013) .

	dcterms:description	"""A large number of neurological disorders are characterized by a clinical syndrome with motor symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity and postural instability. As these clinical features are common to multiple disorders, the clinical syndrome is referred as &ldquo;parkinsonism&rdquo; and when parkinsonism is representing the prevalent part of the syndrome, these are referred as &ldquo;parkinsonian disorders&rdquo;. Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease (PD) is one of parkinsonian disorders and can have an idiopathic, genetic or toxic (i.e. MPTP induced parkinsonism) cause (Dickson 2012). All these disorders include a deregulation of the extrapyramidal system.

The pyramidal motor system comprises bundles of neurons originating in the motor centers of the cerebral cortex to terminate in the brainstem or in the spinal cord where they are responsible for voluntary control of motor functions (Brooks 1971). The extrapyramidal system, which is the anatomical organization of the AO, is the part of the motor system primarily involved in the control and regulation of involuntary motor control, and in fine tuning (Barnes et al., 1983). Especially the initiation and maintenance of complex movement patterns or of neuronal regulatory pathways involved in postural control of the body are regulated by the nigrostriatal system that is affected in parkinsonian states. The CNS input is modulated by extrapyramidal circuits before the execution of complex motor movements. The modulated information from the basal ganglia is looped back through the thalamus to the cortex, from where final motor signals are sent via the pyramidal system; i.e. the basal ganglia system is not involved in the control of motor neurons and striatal muscles, but it modulates the signals from the cortex to these systems. Thus, an impaired input of dopamine into the striatum leads to an impairment of this modulation loop, and a disturbance of basal ganglia feedback to the thalamus and cortex. This ultimately manifests in key parkinsonian symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, or bradykinesia (Bernheimer et al., 1973). These conditions can be generated experimentally by dopamine depletion with reserpine, by inhibition of dopamine receptors, by mechanical or chemical ablation of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons (cut of the median forebrain bundle or injection of the toxicant 6-OH-dopamine) or the application of toxicants that leading to a relatively selective death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (e.g. MPTP) and therefore a reduction of dopamine in the striatum (Kolata et al., 1983).

The basal ganglia include the ventral striatum, the neostriatum composed of the putamen and the caudate nucleus, the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe), the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) (Obeso et al., 2008). The main input sites into basal ganglia are the striatum and the STN where cortical (glutamatergic) innervations terminate in a topographically organized manner that largely reflects the organization in the cortex (Fallon et al., 1978; Takada et al., 1998). Both the GPi and the SNpr represent the main output nuclei projecting into the thalamus (Parent et al., 1999; Alexander et al., 1990). The connection between input and output nuclei is functionally organized into a &ldquo;direct&rdquo; and an &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; pathway (Silverdale et al., 2003). These two pathways in parallel regulate the activity of the basal ganglia output neurons of the GPi and STN and are modulated by dopamine in the striatum. The dopaminergic terminals in teh striatum originate from dopaminergic projections from the SNpc. Striatal dopamine modulates the activity of inhibitory GABAergic medium spiny neurons that make up 90% of all neurons in the striatum (Smith et al., 1994). Medium spiny neurons that preferentially express the D1 dopamine receptor are involved in the direct pathway and directly project into the two main output nuclei (GPi and SNpr). Activation of the D1 medium spiny neuronal direct pathway results in a reduction of the inhibitory basal ganglia output (GPi and SNpr) leading to a dis-inhibition of thalamic target neurons (Bolam et al., 2000). These events ultimately lead to an elevated activity in the respective cortical neurons, i.e. D1 signalling in the striatum leads to an increase in motor activity.

Medium spiny neurons predominantly expressing the D2 dopamine receptor mostly project to the GPe (Gerfen et al., 1990). Activation of D2 expressing neurons leads to an inhibition of their activity. D2 neurons of the indirect pathway connect the striatum with GPi/SNpr via synaptic connections in the GPe and the STN. Activating neurons originating in the STN project into the GPi/SNpr are glutamatergic. From the STN, activating glutamatergic neuronal projections into the GPi/SNpr lead to a basal, low activation. Activation of the indirect pathway by striatal dopamine from the substantia nigra hence leads to a low basal inhibitory GABAergic output into thalamic structures, and thus allows a strong motor cortex activation of the thalamus.



Functional anatomy of basal ganglia. A) Normal conditions. Striatal (STR) dopamine mainly originates from projections originating in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The STR is mainly composed of inhibitory GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSN). MSN involved in the direct pathway directly project to the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) and the sunstantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) leading to a basal inhibition of these output nuclei. MSN involved in the indirect pathway send inhibitory projections to the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe). Their activity is dampened by dopamine binding to D2 receptor expressing MSN in the striatum. B) Lack of striatal dopamine. Under conditions of a lack of striatal dopamine, inhibitory GABAergic neurons, originating in the striatum, receive less activation, resulting in a declined inhibition of GPi and SNpr inhibitory output. In the indirect pathway, the lack of dopamine causes a lack of its inhibitory influence on inhibitory GABAergic projections into the GPe. This accelerated inhibition of the GPe results in a decline in its inhibitory output into the STN. The decline in STN inhibition allows its overactivation, resulting in an excessive activation of stimulatory glutamatergic projections into the GPi and SNpr (according to Silverdale 2003).

Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease is characterized by a decline in striatal dopamine input from the substantia nigra pars compacta (Smith t al., 1994). Under normal conditions, ganglial output via GPi/SNpr nuclei causes a moderate inhibitory influence on cortical and brainstem motor neurons. A reduction in striatal dopamine leads to an underactivation of D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons of the direct pathway. This insufficient activation of the inhibitory GABAergic medium spiny neurons results in a reduction of its normal inhibitory influence on GPi and SNpr output nuclei. As a consequence, dopamine depletion leads to the overactivation of the inhibitory GABAergic GPi/SNpr output via the direct pathway (Mitchell et al., 1989).

In the indirect pathway, the reduced activation of D2 receptors expressing neurons leads to an overactivation of inhibitory output nuclei projecting into the GPe. The resulting inhibitory output of the GPe is hence reduced, thus leading to a declined inhibition of the STN. Overactivation of the stimulatory glutamatergic projections originating in the STN leads to the hyperactivation of the output GPi/SNpr nuclei. As a consequence of striatal dopamine depletion, the direct pathway becomes underactivated and the indirect pathway becomes overactivated. This leads to an overactivation of the basal ganglia output nuclei. Due to their inhibitory influence on thalamocortical motor centers, the resulting reduced cortical activation leads to the prominent impairment of motor functions in parkinsonian states (Silverdale et al.,&nbsp;2003).

The model of direct and indirect pathways linking striatal dopamine content with the basal ganglia output nuclei has been criticized in recent years as it ignores the influence of extrastriatal dopamine (Smith et al.,&nbsp;2000), or the fact that some medium spiny neurons express dopamine receptors of both the D1 and of the D2 type (Surmeier et al., 1996). Principal validity of the model and the central role of striatal dopamine was e.g. demonstrated by L-DOPA-mediated supplementation of striatal dopamine content in unprimed PD patients that causes a partial reduction in the overactivation of GPi/SNpr output (Yuan et al., 2010; Heimer et al., 2006). As an alternative way for symptomatic treatment of parkinsonian conditions, deep brain stimulation of either the STN or the GPi was shown to relieve from parkinsonian motor features (Mazzone 2003, Odekerken 2013).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""For the analysis of striatal dopamine content and its correlation with motor control, both biochemical analysis methods on the cellular and tissue level as well as behavioral tests are required. Available test models are mice and rats on the one hand and non-human primates and humans on the other. Motor impairment features associated with parkinsonian states in man serve as reference standard. Monkey models have the advantage to largely reflect complex motor impairment patterns observed in humans which are rather difficult to assess in rodents. Rodent models in contrast are cost-efficient and allow both biochemical analysis that require major invasive methods as well as basic behavioral tests. Due to the limitations in the assessment of moderate motor impairment in rodents and the well-established correlation between striatal dopamine content and impaired motor output, analysis of striatal dopamine is often applied as surrogate readout for the assessment of motor deficits.

Detection of striatal dopamine (total or extracellular).

The standard method used in the majority of experimental work is the determination of total contents of dopamine and its two degradation metabolites HVA and DOPAC. For this purpose, the striatum is quickly removed from experimental animals, homogenized in a suitable acidic buffer, and the dopamine (metabolites) determined by HPLC with electrochemical detector or by HPLC-MS. For live in vivo detection of extracellular dopamine levels, a microdialysis probe is inserted into the striatum. Microdialysis can be performed in anesthetized animals or freely moving animals; basal dopamine levels or stimulated levels (amphetamine, KCl) can be recorded. Dopamine and its metabolites are detected in the dialysate either by HPLC or by HPLC-mass spectrometry analysis (Saraswat 1981, Cui 2009, Gonzalez 2011).

Detection of dopamine neuron terminals in the striatum.

As alternative to the detection of striatal dopamine that is to a large extent limited to live detection setups due to its instability in tissues, the number of remaining dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta was suggested as alternative readout (Burns 1983). It allows the analysis of ex vivo samples without the limitations associated with the instability and reactivity of extravesicular dopamine. Although the number of surviving dopamine neurons in the SNpc in PD or in complex-I inhibitor challenged test animals is a valuable parameter on its own, it was discovered that the number of DA neurons in the SNpc not necessarily correlates with the amount of dopamine released in the striatum. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was regularly stained as marker for DA neurons, however it was observed that TH expression was very variable following MPTP intoxication in the absence of cell death and therefore has only limited suitability for the assessment of DA neuronal numbers (Aznavour 2012). Second, many DA neurites and terminals displayed damage or degradation in the absence of death of the corresponding neuronal cell (Ling 2015). Hence, even in the presence of viable DA neurons in the SNpc, their corresponding terminals could no longer be able to release dopamine into the striatum. Staining of DA neuronal terminals in the striatum is therefore used as a more reliable indirect marker for striatal dopamine content. For the analysis of nigrostriatal terminals, the dopamine transporter (DAT) is visualized either by antibody-mediated staining in tissue slices or by the application of radioactively labeled DAT ligands that allow their application both in vivo and in ex vivo samples (Morris 1996).

Behavioral tests: Rodent models.

Rotation: the rotation model of Ungerstedt et al (Ungerstedt 1970) is based on the unilateral lesion of the nigrostriatal dopamine neuron system either in rodents or in non-human primates. The lesion can be produced either surgivally, or by stereotaxic infusion of e.g. 6-OHDA into the nigrostriatal system of one hemisphere, or by infusion of MPTP through one carotid (single sided). After the lesion, animals are left to recover, then the dopamine system is stimulated by injection of amphetamine. The asymmetry of remaining dopamine neurons (only on one side) triggers spontaneous asymmetric motor behaviour, i.e. rotations of the animals. Each full turn of an animal is recorded, the respective numbers of left- and right turns are plotted versus time, respectively. In the standard rotation model, monkeys become hypokinetic in the limbs on the contralateral side of the brain hemisphere treated. Rats preferentially rotate towards the side of the lesion upon treatment with drugs that trigger activation of the remaining dopamine neurons.

Rotarod: assessment of motor coordination. The animals are placed on a rotating rod that is subjected to linear acceleration. The latency to fall from the rod is detected (Jones 1968). Hang test: Detection of neuromuscular strength. Mice are placed on a horizontal grid. When the animals grabbed the grid with their fore- and hindpaws, the grid is inverted with the animal hanging upside down. In a typical setup, mice are required to remain on the grid for at least 30 s (Tillerson 2002).

Forepaw Stride length during walking. Ink is applied to the forepaws and the mice walk across a blank sheet of paper. Training of the animals to walk across the white paper in a straight line without stopping is performed before the respective treatment. The distance between single steps on each side are measured (Klapdor 1997).

Grid test: Mice hang upside down for 30 s on the grid that is also used for the Hang test and are recorded on video for closer analysis. With this method, the average forepaw distance is measured by assessing the distance covered, divided by the number of successful forepaw steps. In the course of the analysis, the number of unsuccessful forepaw steps are detected and displayed as percentage of the total number of steps performed (Crawley 1999).

Akinesia: the animal is placed on a flat surface and the latency until it has moved all of its four limbs is assessed.

Open field test: Infrared beams detect the animals activity for the determination of parameters such as the time spent locomoting, the distance travelled, or the number of rearings.

Pole test: the animal is placed on a gauze-taped pole with the head upwards below the top of the pole. Two parameters are detected: 1) time until animals turn by 180&deg;; 2) time until the animals reach the floor.

Non-invasive imaging of DA neuron terminals

Positron emission tomography (PET): Based on its appropriate half life time of ca. 2 h for clinical investigations, fluorine-18 labeled L-[18F]-fluorodopa is routinely used in trace amounts for intravenous administration. Striatal uptake of L-[18F]-fluorodopa is followed by applying positron emission tomography (PET) (Leenders 1986).

Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT): monitoring of dopamine transporter (DAT). Iodine-123-&beta;-CIT is used as a sensitive ligand for dopamine and serotonin transporters and was applied in monkeys and humans (Winogrodzka 2003).

Human neurological tests

A recent systematic review and evaluation of currently used rating scales for the assessment of motor impairment and disability in PD patients identified the 1) Columbia University rating scale, 2) the Northwestern University Disability Scale, and 3) the Unified Parkinsons Disease rating scale as the most evaluated and reliable scales available (Ramaker 2002). All scales evaluate several parameters, some of which are not motor related. Thus, only subscales are useful for readout of motor symptoms (e.g. 13 of the 42 UPDRS parameters). Of these, not all are equally dependent on nigrostriatal dopamine. Examination needs to be done by a trained neurologist.

	dcterms:description	"""PPAR&alpha; acts as a nuclear signaling element that controls the transcription of a variety of genes involved in lipid catabolism and energy production pathways (Desvergne and Wahli 1999, Kersten 2014). Fatty acids serve as the ligands that stimulate PPAR&alpha; nuclear signaling where the fatty acids (likely in association with fatty acid binding proteins) bind to the ligand binding domain of PPAR&alpha; along with co-activators to the PPAR&alpha; regulatory complex at promoter regions of PPAR&alpha;-regulated genes (termed PPAR response elements, PPREs) initiating the transcription of genes that metabolize the fatty acids (Ahmed et al 2007, Wolfrum et al. 2001, Desvergne and Wahli 1999, Kersten 2014, Xu et al 2001, Janssen et al 2015).&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Specifically, PPAR&alpha; contains both a ligand-binding domain that binds fatty acids and a DNA-binding domain that initiates binding to PPREs in the promoter regions of PPAR&alpha;-regulated genes (Ahmed et al 2007, Hihi et al 2002).&nbsp; Binding of the fatty acid ligands to PPAR&alpha; facilitates heterodimeric binding with another ligand-activated nuclear receptor, the retinoid X receptor (RXR), forming an activated PPAR-RXR transcriptional regulator complex (DiRenzo et al 1997, Ahmed et al 2007).&nbsp; PPAR competes for binding to RXR with retinoic acid receptors (RARs) where the RAR/RXR heterodimer inhibits transcription of genes downstream of PPREs (DiRenzo et al 1997).&nbsp; Transcriptional regulation activity of the PPAR/RXR complex is also influenced by the binding and release of accessory molecules that act as coactivators such as steroid receptor co-activator 1 (SRC-1) or as corepressors such as nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR, DiRenzo et al 1997, Ahmed et al 2007, Xu et al 2002, Liu et al 2008).&nbsp; Such binding of the co-repressor N-CoR to the PPAR&alpha;/RXR&alpha; complex has been demonstrated to inhibit the potential for transcriptional transactivation (Xu et al 2002, Liu et al 2008).&nbsp; The exact mechanisms by which the PPAR/RXR complex facilitate transcription are still not well understood.&nbsp; It has been observed that RXR contains a highly conserved motif at the C-terminal end of the ligand-binding domain known as activating function 2 (AF2) which undergoes conformational changes allowing interaction with coactivators / corepressors, the former of which is hypothesized to recruit the components of the transcriptional machinery necessary to transcribe the downstream gene (DiRenzo et al 1997).&nbsp; Even the basal transcriptional machinery itself is recognized to vary across cell types and the prototypical preinitiation complex (PIC) is inherently highly flexible, confirmationally diverse including multi-faceted interactions of activators, core promotion factors, the RNA polymerase II enzyme, elongation factors, and chromatin remodeling complexes all combined at the promoter to facilitate gene transcription (Levine et al 2014).&nbsp; Additionally, recent transcriptomic research coupling transcriptomic expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing to identify PPAR&alpha; binding to PPREs suggests PPAR&alpha; may exert transcriptional regulation beyond its direct genomic targets via secondary signaling networks including various kinases (McMullen et al 2014).&nbsp; Given the current KE (KE2, PPARalpha transactivation of gene expression, Decreased), a variety of upstream influences may impair the function of the PPAR&alpha;-RXR&alpha; heterodimer and/or affect coactivator / corepressor binding leading to decreased PIC competence resulting in impaired transcription of downstream genes as well as secondary signaling networks.

&nbsp;

PPAR&alpha; regulates expression of genes encoding nearly every enzymatic step of fatty acid catabolism including fatty acid uptake into cells, fatty acid activation to acyl-CoAs, and the release of cellular energy from fatty acids through the oxidative breakdown of acyl-CoAs to acetyl-CoA, and in starvation conditions, the repackaging of Acetyl-CoA substrates into ketone bodies via ketogenesis pathways (Kersten 2014, Desvergne and Wahli 1999, Evans et al 2004). &nbsp;A pathway-level schematic for PPAR&alpha; transactivation is illustrated in KEGG Pathway map03320 providing the specific gene targets and associated functional responses that are transcriptionally regulated by PPAR&alpha;. It should be noted that there are species-specific differences in PPAR&alpha; transactivation of gene expression among mice and humans which are explained in the &ldquo;Evidence Supporting Taxonomic Applicability&rdquo; section, below.

	dcterms:description	"""PPAR&alpha; acts as a positive transcriptional regulator for many of the genes involved in ketogenesis (Desvergne and Wahili 1999, Kersten 2014).&nbsp; Thus, decreased PPAR&alpha; nuclear signaling results in decreased transcriptional expression of genes that are regulated by PPAR&alpha;, and subsequently, decreased expression of the coded proteins and enzymes that ultimately impair ketogenesis.&nbsp; Ketogenesis is critical to supporting general systemic energy homeostasis in fasting events (Cahill 2006, Evans et al 2004, Sengupta et al 2010), thus KE4 becomes important after short term energy stores (glycogen) become limited (Muoio et al 2002). &nbsp;Le May et al (2000) have shown decreased ketogenesis &nbsp;in livers of PPAR null mice linked to impaired mitochondrial hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (Hmgcs) gene expression.

Genes Involved: &nbsp;Not only does PPAR&alpha; regulate the genes that catalyze the upstream production of the raw materials utilized in ketogenesis through fatty acid beta-oxidation (see decreased peroxisomal (KE3) and mitochondrial (KE4) fatty acid beta oxidation, upstream), but also directly induces key enzymes in the ketogenesis pathway including Hmgcs2, Hmgcl, and Acat1 (Kersten et al 2014, Le May et al 2000). PPAR&alpha; is recognized as the master transcriptional activator of ketogenic genes (Sengupta et al 2010, Desvergne and Wahli 1999).

&nbsp;

Metabolism Affected:&nbsp; The liver plays a key role in processing the fundamental energy substrate, acetyl-CoA, into metabolic currencies that contribute to the systemic cellular energy needs of the whole organism.&nbsp; The liver represents a key organ involved in systemic energy distribution given its ability to synthesize glucose (an ability shared only with the kidney, Gerich et al 2001) as well as its exclusive role in the generation of ketone bodies (Cahill 2006, Sengupta et al 2010, Kersten 2014). &nbsp;This is especially important for the metabolic energy needs of the brain which can only use glucose and the ketone body, &beta;-hydroxybutyrate for cellular energy production (Cahill 2006, Owen 2005, Kersten 2014).&nbsp; Therefore, ketogenesis is critical to supporting general systemic energy homeostasis in fasting events (Cahill 2006, Evans et al 2004, Sengupta et al 2010).&nbsp; Interference with ketogenesis, for example by PPAR&alpha; inhibition, has been demonstrated to inhibit &beta;-hydroxybutyrate production (measured in serum) during fasting events in mice (Le May et al 2000, Badman et al 2007, Potthoff 2009, Sengupta et al 2010) and cause hypoketonemia (Muoio et al 2002).&nbsp; The Badman et al (2007) study indicated that metabolism of fatty acid substrates (measured as liver triglycerides) that would otherwise contribute to &beta;-hydroxybutyrate production was additionally inhibited under PPAR&alpha; knockout.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In a fasting state, humans transition from the use of exogenous glucose to glucose derived from glycogen within 4 hours with a steadily increasing proportion of glucose usage that is derived from gluconeogenesis up to 2 days (Cahill 2006).&nbsp; Beyond 2 days of fasting, ketone body production (&beta;-hydroxybutyrate) increasingly supports the energy demands of the brain (Cahill 2006).&nbsp;

	dcterms:description	"""A fundamental process in biological systems is the production of metabolic fuel for use in meeting the energy demands of cells and, in multi-cellular organisms, supporting overall systemic energy needs.&nbsp; Physiological studies of the progression of human starvation have identified that the preferred metabolic fuel is glucose in the fed state and progressing through two days of fasting, afterward ketone bodies become increasingly important for meeting energy demands (Cahill 2006, Owen et al 2005).&nbsp; Substrates derived from carbohydrates, fats and protein can contribute to gluconeogenesis (Cahill 2006, Gerich et al 2001) whereas substrates derived from fatty acids are the primary contributors to ketogenesis (Desvergne and Wahli 1999).&nbsp; Mobilization of fatty acids as a metabolic fuel source increase dramatically during fasting to support both gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis (Evans et al 2004). &nbsp;&nbsp;Cahill (2006) and colleagues have demonstrated the importance of ketone body production, especially &beta;-hydroxybutyrate, for maintaining energy homeostasis during starvation.&nbsp; &beta;-hydroxybutyrate serves as an alternative substrate to glucose for providing energy to the brain in the starvation state, providing ATP at higher efficiency relative to the glucose substrate (Cahill 2006).&nbsp; Interference with ketogenesis, for example by PPAR&alpha; inhibition, has been demonstrated to inhibit &beta;-hydroxybutyrate production (measured in serum) during fasting events in mice (Badman et al 2007, Potthoff 2009, Sengupta et al 2010) and cause hypoketonemia (Muoio et al 2002).&nbsp; The Badman et al (2007) study indicated that metabolism of fatty acid substrates (measured as liver triglycerides) that would otherwise contribute to &beta;-hydroxybutyrate production was inhibited under PPAR&alpha; knockout.&nbsp; &nbsp;Increased concentrations of circulating ketone bodies is indicative of potential metabolic fuel deficits in fasting animals (Cahill 2006), and a lack of increase in circulating ketone bodies during fasting, especially in conjunction with elevated blood triglycerides, indicates impaired ketogenesis and potentially impaired bioenergetic potential. Although the potential therapeutic implications of increased ketone body metabolism via ketogenic diets for various disease states has been discussed (Veech 2004), no studies were found demonstrating effects on whole organism responses to impaired ketogenesis over long-term starvation events.&nbsp; A potential implication of decreased ketone body production is stress on cardiac function given that energy-stressed heart tissue shifts reliance away from fatty acids toward ketone bodies (&beta;-hydroxybutyrate) to fuel production of the ATP needed to maintain the heart&rsquo;s mechanical function (Aubert et al 2016).&nbsp; Related to this observation, PPAR&alpha;-knockout mice reached exhaustion sooner than wild types in an exercise challenge which corresponded with significantly decreased &beta;-hydroxybutyrate in serum indicating hypoketonemia in PPAR&alpha;-knockout mice versus wild types (Muoio et al 2002).&nbsp; Overall, diminished PPAR&alpha; function, especially in combination with fasting /diminished nutrition and/or excessive exercise may contribute to impaired maintenance on systemic energy budget.

	dcterms:description	"""If caloric intake is less than caloric use over time, an individual will lose body weight.&nbsp; This is a basic principle in human dieting as well as an important principle related to individual health and ecological fitness of animal populations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dynamic energy budget theory has provided useful insights on how organisms take up, assimilate and then allocate energy to various fundamental biological processes including maintenance, growth, development and reproduction (Nisbet et al 2000).&nbsp; Regarding energy allocation, somatic maintenance must first be met before then growth may occur, followed by maturation and then finally, surplus energy is dedicated to reproduction (Nisbet et al 2000).&nbsp; As an example of the importance of energy allocation to ecological fitness, a review by Martin et al (1987) demonstrated that energy availability (availability of food) was the predominant limiting factor in reproductive success and survival for both young and parents in a broad life history review &nbsp;for bird species.&nbsp; This is a likely scenario for many organisms.

Various physiological processes act to maintain and prioritize energy allocations in individuals.&nbsp; The influence of PPARalpha on systemic energy metabolism and energy homeostasis has been broadly established (see reviews by Kersten 2014, Evans et al 2004, Desvergne and Wahli 1999).&nbsp; Inhibition of PPARalpha predominantly impairs lipid metabolism with respect to overall energy metabolism whereby energy release from fatty acid substrates is decreased.&nbsp; PPARalpha has been demonstrated to play a critical role in stimulating fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis during fasting resulting in increased ketone body levels in plasma (Badman et al 2007, Kersten 2014) a response that is eliminated in PPARalpha knockout mice (Badman et al 2007, Sanderson et al 2010).&nbsp;&nbsp; A reviews by Cahill (2006) and Wang et al (2010) summarize the critical adaptive response of ketogenesis during fasting for maintaining systemic energy homeostasis by providing ketone bodies to energetically fuel a diverse range of tissues, especially the brain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only does PPARalpha induce the upstream production of the raw materials for use in ketogenesis through fatty acid beta-oxidation, but also directly induces key enzymes in the ketogenesis pathway including Hmgcs2, Hmgcl and Acat1 (Kersten 2014).

Kersten et al (1999) and Badman et al (2007) demonstrated that PPARalpha-null mice were unable to actively mobilize fatty acid oxidation, and further, Kersten et al (1999) demonstrated that these mice were unable to meet energy demands during fasting and leading to hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypoketonemia and fatty liver.&nbsp;&nbsp; Observations from toxicological and toxicogenomic research have implicated nitrotoluenes as potential PPAR antagonists in birds (Rawat et al 2010), rats (Deng et al 2011) and mice (Wilbanks et al 2014), an effect that additionally corresponded with weight loss in rats (Wilbanks et al 2014) and weight loss, loss of muscle mass and emaciation in birds (Quinn et al 2007).&nbsp; These combined results indicate that inhibition of PPARalpha signaling and the resultant decrease in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis can detrimentally impair systemic energy budgets leading to starvation-like effects and resultant weight loss.&nbsp; As reviewed in the introductory paragraph of this adverse outcome description, impaired energy availability leading to inability to meet somatic maintenance needs and causing negative growth are likely to have detrimental effects on survivorship, reproduction and ecological fitness. Such affects may adversely affect responses of regulatory concern including:&nbsp; individual health, survival, and population sustainability.

	dcterms:description	"""PPAR&alpha; acts as a positive transcriptional regulator for many of the genes involved in peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid beta oxidation as well as genes involved in the pre- and post-processing of fatty acids in peroxisomal pathways (Desvergne and Wahili 1999, Kersten 2014).&nbsp; Thus, decreased PPAR&alpha; nuclear signaling results in decreased transcriptional expression of genes that are regulated by PPAR&alpha;, and subsequently, decreased expression of the coded proteins and enzymes that ultimately decreased fatty acid metabolism within peroxisomes and mitochondria.&nbsp; In PPAR&alpha; knock-out mice, fatty acid oxidation capacity was decreased in well fed, rested mice and the reduced fatty acid oxidation capacity was greatly exacerbated during exercise challenge or 24h starvation (Muoio et al 2002).

&nbsp;

Genes Involved:&nbsp; The first gene target identified for PPAR&alpha; was Acyl-CoA oxidase (Acox1, Dreyer et al 1992) which represents the first enzyme in peroxisomal long-chain fatty acid oxidation (Kersten 2014) and is also the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway (Desvergne and Wahili 1999).&nbsp; In addition to Acox1, a variety of additional enzymes involved in peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism are under transcriptional control of PPAR&alpha; transactivation including enzymes that facilitate fatty acid uptake into the peroxisome (Abcd1, Abcd2 and Abcd 3), conversion of acyl-CoA/acetyl-CoA to acyl-carnitine/acetyl-carnitine (Crot/Crat), and conversion of acyl-CoAs back to fatty acids via thioesterases (Acots, as reviewed in Kersten 2014).&nbsp; PPARalpha also has transcriptional control over enzymes downstream of Acox1 in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of acyl-CoA pathway including L-bifunctional enzyme (Ehhadh), D-bifunctional enzyme (Hsd17b4), and peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase activity (Acaa1a, Acaa1b, as reviewed in Kersten 2014).&nbsp; All of these genes are potential targets for screening affects within this KE.

&nbsp;

As reviewed in Kersten (2014), the genes (and associated functions) regulated by PPAR&alpha; in the mitochondrial processing of fatty acids include the following:&nbsp; (1) Import of acyl-CoAs into the mitochondria is facilitated by PPAR&alpha;-induced increases in expression of carnitine palmitoyl-transferases 1a, 1b, and 1 (Cpt1a, Cpt1b, Cpt2) and acyl-carnitine translocase (Slc25a20; Brandt et al 1998, Mascaro et al 1998, Feige et al 2010).&nbsp; (2) The first step of mitochondrial beta-oxidation is catalyzed by length-specific acyl-CoA hydrogenases (Acadvl, Acadl, Acadm, Acads; Aoyama et al 1998, Gulick et al 1994).&nbsp; (3) The three subsequent steps in mitochondrial beta-oxidation that successively release acetyl-CoAs from the hydrocarbon chain are catalyzed by the mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme (Hadha and Hadhb).&nbsp; These enzymes are replaced upon progressive chain shortening by Hadh and Acaa2.&nbsp; (4) the final PPARalpha targets include Eci1, Eci2, Decr1, and Hsd17b10 which convert unsaturated and 2-methlylated aclyl-CoAs into intermediates of beta-oxidation (Sanderson et al 2008, Aoyama et al 1998).&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Metabolism Affected:&nbsp; Peroxisomes participate in a variety of lipid metabolic pathways including the beta-oxidation of very long-straight chain (&lt;20 C in length) or branched &ndash;chain acyl-CoAs (Lazarow 1978, Kersten 2014).&nbsp; The peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway is not directly coupled to the electron transport chain and oxidative phosporylation, therefore the first oxidation reaction loses energy to heat (H2O2 production) while in the second step, energy is captured in the metabolically accessible form of high-energy electrons in NADH (Mannaerts and Van Veldhoven 1993, Desvergne and Wahli 1999).&nbsp; The peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway provides fatty acid chain shortening where two carbons are removed in each round of oxidation in the form of acetyl-CoA (Desvergne and Wahli 1999).&nbsp; The acetyl-CoA monomers serve as fundamental units for metabolic energy production (ATP)&nbsp; via the citric acid cycle followed by electron-transport chain mediated oxidative phosphorylation (Nelson and Cox, 2000A) as well as serve as the fundamental units for energy storage via gluconeogenesis (Nelson and Cox, 2000B) and lipogenesis (Nelson and Cox, 2000C).&nbsp; The shortened chain fatty acids (&lt;20C) can then be transported to the mitochondria to undergo mitochondrial beta-oxidation for complete metabolism of the carbon substrate for cellular energy production (Desvergne and Wahli 1999).

&nbsp;

Mitochondrial processing of fatty acids involves:&nbsp; (1) Import of short, medium and long chain fatty acids (&lt;C20) acyl-CoAs into the mitochondria by carnitine palmitoyl-transferases 1a, 1b, and 1 (Cpt1a, Cpt1b, Cpt2) and acyl-carnitine translocase (Slc25a20, Brandt et al 1998; Mascaro et al 1998, Kersten et al 2014).&nbsp; (2) The first step of beta-oxidation catalyzed by the length-specific acyl-CoA hydrogenases (Acadvl, Acadl, Acadm, Acads; Aoyama et al 1998, Gulick et al 1994, Kersten et al 2014).&nbsp; (3) The three subsequent steps in mitochondrial beta-oxidation that successively release acetyl-CoAs from the hydrocarbon chain are catalyzed by the mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme (Hadha and Hadhb, Kersten et al 2014).&nbsp; These enzymes are replaced upon progressive chain shortening by Hadh and Acaa2 (Kersten et al 2014).&nbsp; (4) The conversion of unsaturated and 2-methylated acetyl-CoAs into intermediates of beta-oxidation are catalyzed by Eci1, Eci2, Decr1, and Hsd17b10 (Sanderson et al 2008, Aoyama et al 1998, Kersten et al 2014).&nbsp; Interestingly, tissue-specific differences in sensitivity to PPAR&alpha; knock out have been observed in mice where fatty acid oxidation was markedly impaired in liver and heart tissues whereas skeletal muscle was largely unaffected due to seven-fold increased abundance of PPAR&delta; in skeletal muscle tissue (Muoio et al 2007).&nbsp; Redundancy in regulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism across PPAR&alpha;, PPAR&beta;, PPAR&delta;, and PPAR&gamma; are known in canonical signaling pathways (KEGG Pathway map03320) where metabolic responses are coordinated across the iso-types with whole-organism-level effects on insulin sensitivity, body fat, and body weight (Harrington et al 2007).&nbsp;
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Beta oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria was measured using mouse liver homogenates where a radio-labeled fatty acid substrate was reacted for 30 minutes and then centrifuged to separate reaction products for fractional radioactivity measurements in Aoyama et al (1998).&nbsp; Comparative measures of reaction products were also measured where potassium cyanide was added to the reaction mixture to inhibit mitochondrial beta oxidation activity to normalize the contribution of mitochondrial enzymatic reactions to the overall reaction product (Aoyama et al 1998).&nbsp; In Muoio et al (2002), capacity for beta oxidation of fatty acids in serum was determined by measuring the nonesterified fatty acids and transcript expression was quantified using RT-qPCR.&nbsp; Harrington et al (2007) administered agonists for the various PPARs and PPARpan (affecting all PPARs simultaneously) used ex vivo quantification of PPAR-induced fatty acid oxidation of 14C-labeled fatty acids to CO2.

&nbsp;

A variety of transcript expression assays have been used to demonstrate the effect of PPAR&alpha; signaling inhibition on downstream transcript expression (see literature cited above for specific methods within each investigation).&nbsp; Investigation of PPAR&alpha; transcriptional targets (especially those involved in fatty acid metabolism) have been conducted via variety of methods, with RT-qPCR being the benchmark standard (Kersten 2014 and Feige et al 2010).&nbsp; Spectroscopic analysis of the characteristic absorption bands for fatty acid substrates and fatty acid beta oxidation products were examined for peroxisomal fractions purified from rat livers by differential and of equilibrium density centrifugation (Lazarow 1978).&nbsp; Additionally, NAD reduction assays were conducted for acyl-CoA substrates with varying chain lengths where increased oxidation was observed for substrates with long chain length relative to short chain acyl-CoAs (Lazarow 1978).

The female ovarian cycle is the result of a balanced cooperation between several organs and is determined by a complex interaction of hormones. Ovarian cycle irregularities include disturbances in the ovarian cycle (e.g. longer cycle, persistent estrus) and/or ovulation problems (deferred ovulation or anovulation). 
The estrous cycle (also oestrous cycle) comprises the recurring physiologic changes that are induced by reproductive hormones in females. Estrous cycles start after sexual maturity in females and are interrupted by anestrous phases or pregnancies. During this cycle numerous well defined and sequential alterations in reproductive tract histology, physiology and cytology occur, initiated and regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. The central feature of the mammalian estrous cycle is the periodic maturation of eggs that will be released at ovulation and luteinisation of the follicles after ovulation to form corpora lutea.
Adapted from www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/testing/43754807.pdf

Biological compartments
The cyclic changes that occur in the female reproductive tract are initiated and regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. Although folliculogenesis occurs independently of hormonal stimulation up until the formation of early tertiary follicles, the gonadotrophins luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are essential for the completion of follicular maturation and development of mature preovulatory (Graafian) follicles. 
The oestrous cycle consists of four stages: prooestrus, oestrus, metoestrus (or dioestrus 1) and dioestrus (or dioestrus 2) orchestrated by hormones.
Levels of LH and FSH begin to increase just after dioestrus. Both hormones are secreted by the same secretory cells (gonadotrophs) in the pars distalis of the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis). FSH stimulates the development of the zona granulosa and triggers expression of LH receptors by granulosa cells. LH initiates the synthesis and secretion of androstenedione and, to a lesser extent, testosterone by the theca interna; these androgens are utilised by granulosa cells as substrates in the synthesis of estrogen. Pituitary release of gonadotrophins thus drives follicular maturation and secretion of estrogen during prooestrus.
Gonadotrophin secretion by the anterior pituitary is regulated by luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), produced by the hypothalamus. LHRH is transported along the axons of hypothalamic neurones to the median eminence where it is secreted into the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system and transported to the anterior pituitary. The hypothalamus secretes LHRH in rhythmic pulses; this pulsatility is essential for the normal activation of gonadotrophs and subsequent release of LH and FSH. 
Adapted from www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/testing/43754807.pdf
Follicles that produce estrogens have sequestered pituitary FSH which in turn stimulates the aromatase reaction. Such follicles can undergo normal development and ovulation and contain eggs that readily resume meiosis when released. In the absence of an active local aromatase (i.e., no follicle-stimulating hormone), the follicles and oocytes become atretic and regress without ovulating. If aromatase is present, the estrogen and follicle stimulating hormone can further develop the follicular cells for normal luteal function after ovulation takes place (Ryan, 1982).
General role in biology
A sequential progression of interrelated physiological and behavioural cycles underlines the female's successful production of young. In many but not all species the first and most basic of these is estrous cycle, which is itself a combination of cycles.

The pattern of events in the estrous cycle may provide a useful indicator of the normality of reproductive neuroendocrine and ovarian function in the nonpregnant female. It also provides a means to interpret hormonal, histologic, and morphologic measurements relative to stage of the cycle, and can be useful to monitor the status of mated females. 
Regular cyclicity is one of the key parameters in assessment of female reproductive function in rodents. 
Parameters assessed for cyclicity:
- Number of cycling females
- Number of females with regular cycles
- Number of cycles
- Estrous cycle length
- Percentage of time spent in the various estrous cycle stages
Estrous cyclicity provides a method for evaluating the endocrine disrupting activity of each test chemical under physiologic conditions where endogenous concentrations of estrogen vary. Abnormal cycles were defined as one or more estrous cycles in the 21-day period with prolonged estrus (‚â•3 days) and/or prolonged metestrus or diestrus (‚â•4 days) within a given cycle (Goldman, Murr, &amp; Cooper, 2007).
Estrous cycle normality can be monitored in the rat and mouse by observing the changes in the vaginal smear cytology. Visual observation of the vagina is the quickest method, requires no special equipment, and is best used when only proestrus or estrus stages need to be identified. For details see: (Westwood, 2008), (Byers, Wiles, Dunn, &amp; Taft, 2012) and OECD guidelines (www.oecd.org). 
The observation that animals do not ovulate while exhibiting estrous cycles indicates that estrous cyclicity alone may not be a sufficient surrogate of healthy function of ovaries; the measurements of serum hormones and particularly FSH can contribute to more sensitivity indicators of healthy function of ovaries (Davis, Maronpot, &amp; Heindel, 1994).
Monitoring of oestrus cyclicity is included in OECD test guidelines (Test No. 407: Repeated Dose 28-day Oral Toxicity Study in Rodents, 2008) [1], (Test No. 416: Two-Generation Reproduction Toxicity, 2001)[2] and (Test No. 443: Extended One-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study, 2012) [3]and in USA EPA OCSPP 890.1450.
In vitro testing
The follicle culture models were developed for the in-vitro production of mature oocytes and used to study the process of folliculogenesis and oogenesis in vitro (Cortvrindt &amp; Smitz, 2002). These in vitro cultures demonstrate near-identical effects to those found in vivo, therefore might be able to acquire a place in fertility testing, replacing some in-vivo studies for ovarian function and female gamete quality testing (Stefansdottir, Fowler, Powles-Glover, Anderson, &amp; Spears, 2014).

	dcterms:description	"""Biological state
Aromatase (Cyp19a1, estrogen synthetase, estrogen synthase) is an enzyme responsible for a key step in the biosynthesis of estrogens, in particular it is  responsible for conversion of C-19 androgens into C-18 estrogens (E R Simpson et al., 1994), (Ryan, 1982). It is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (Ryan, 1982). The aromatase gene uses multiple promoters in a tissue-specific manner, resulting in a tissue-specific regulation of aromatase activity (Evan R Simpson, 2004). The cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway is considered to be the primary signalling cascade through which the gonadal Cyp19 promoter is regulated (Stocco, 2008).  
Biological compartments
Aromatase in the specialized cells of the ovary, hypothalamus, and placenta has a crucial role in reproduction for mammalian and other vertebrates by converting androgens to estrogens. This enzyme is also present in various other tissues, such as skin, fat, bone marrow, liver, adrenals, and testes (Ryan, 1982).
General role in biology
The ovarian aromatase produces systemic and locally acting estrogens for general reproductive functions. The systemic estrogen produced by ovarian aromatase modulates the central nervous system and pituitary functions for the ovarian cycle and in spontaneously ovulating mammals it triggers the release of the ovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (Ryan, 1982), (Hillier, 1985). Because only a single gene (CYP19) encodes aromatase in humans, targeted disruption of this gene or inhibition of its product effectively eliminates estrogen biosynthesis  (Evan R Simpson et al., 2002).
Much attention has been given to the regulation of the aromatase gene and its implication in the development and progression of human estrogen-dependent diseases, including breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and endometriosis, see review (Bulun et al., 2005).

	dcterms:description	"""Thyroid hormones (TH) are present in brain tissue of most vertebrate species, and thyroxine (T4) is converted to triiodothyronine locally in this tissue. &nbsp;The amount of THs in brain is known to vary during development and to differ among brain regions (Calvo et al., 1990; Kester et al., 2004; Tu et al., 1999). In human cerebral cortex, T3 increases steadily from 13-weeks, reaching adult levels by 20 weeks post conception. This occurs despite very low and unchanging levels in fetal serum T3, when fetal serum T4 increases 3-fold over the same period. This indicates that T3 in fetal brain is locally generated from serum-derived T4 via the activity of deiodinases, primarily DIO2. DIO2 serves to convert T4 to T3. During this time in fetal development DIO3 activity, which converts T3 to the inactive reverse T3 (rT3), remains very low in cortex. &nbsp;In contrast, in other brain regions including hippocampus and cerebellum, T3 remains low throughout early and mid-gestation and corresponds with high activity of DIO3 in these brain regions. In late gestation and after birth, DIO3 levels drop in hippocampus and cerebellum with a corresponding increase in T3 concentrations (Kester et al., 2004).&nbsp;

A similar spatial and temporal profile of deiodinase activity and corresponding brain hormone concentrations has been observed in rodent brain (Calvo et al., 1990; Tu et al., 1999). In the rat, either whole brain or cortex have been preferentially assessed due to the low levels of hormones present and the small tissue volumes&nbsp;make quantitification difficult. Brain T3 and T4 rise in parallel from gestational day 10 to gestational day 20 in rat. They are typically both quite low until gestational 17 with steep increases between GD18 and GD20 corresponding to the onset of fetal thyroid function (Calvo et al., 1990; Ruiz de Ono et al., 1988; Obergon et al., 1981). Just before birth, brain T3 and T4 concentrations are about one-third to one-half that of adult brain. Brain development in the early postnatal period in rat is roughly equivalent to the 3rd trimester in humans such that adult levels of T3 and T4 in brain are not reached in rodents until the 2nd-3rd postnatal week.

For THs to gain access to brain tissue they need to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) which regulates the active transport of TH into neurons. Many transporter proteins have been identified, and the monocarboxylate transporters (Mct8, Mct10) and anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP1c1) show the highest degree of affinity towards TH and are prevalent in brain (Jansen et al., 2007; Mayer et al., 2014).&nbsp; Transporters express a distinct distribution pattern that varies by tissue and age (Friesema et al., 2005; Henneman et al., 2001; Visser et al., 2007; Heuer et al., 2005; Muller and Heuer, 2007). Although several transporters have been identified, current knowledge of cell specific profile of transporters is limited.&nbsp;

Most of the hormone transported across the blood brain barrier is in the form of T4, primarily though the cellular membrane transporters (e.g., OATP1c1 transporter) into the astrocyte (Visser and Visser, 2012; Sugiyama et al., 2003; Tohyama et al., 2004). Within the astrocyte, T4 is converted into T3 via the local activity of deiodinase 2 (DIO2) (Guadano-Ferraz et al., 1997).&nbsp; A small amount of T3 may cross the blood brain barrier directly via the T3-specific transporter, MCT8 (Heuer et al., 2005). Although&nbsp;in mature brain T3 derives partially from the circulation and from the deiodination of T4, in the fetal brain T3 is exclusively a product of T4 deiodination (Calvo et al., 1990; Grijota-Martinez et al., 2011). In both cases, only the required amount of T3 is utilized in neurons and the excess is degraded by the neuron-specific deiodinase DIO3 (Tu et al., 1999; St. Germain et al., 2009; Hernandez et al., 2010).

Both deiodinase and transporter expression in brain peak in different brain regions at different times in fetal and neonatal life (Kester et al., 2004; Bates et al., 1999; Muller and Heuer, 2014; Heuer, 2007). Collectively, these spatial and temporal patterns of transporter expression and deiodinase activity provide exquisite control of brain T3 available for nuclear receptor activation and regulated gene expression.

Distribution of TH in the brain differs between brain regions; for instance midbrain and telencephalon appear to be places of high signalling. This signalling pattern in adult mouse is well correlated with T3 distribution measured in various brain areas (Constantinou et al., 2005; Chatonnet et al., 2011; Moog et al., 2017).

	mmo:0000000	"""Radioimmunoassays (RIAs) are commonly used to detect TH in the brain (e.g., Obregon et al., 1982; Calvo et al., 1990; Morse et al., 1996; Bansal et al., 2005; Gilbert et al., 2013). The method (and minor variants) is well established in the published literature. However, it is not available in a simple &#39;kit&#39; and requires technical knowledge of RIAs, thus has not been used in most routine toxicology studies. Evaluations in neuronal tissue are complicated by the difficulty of the fatty matrix, heterogeneity of regions within the brain, and low tissue concentrations and small tissue amounts especially in immature brain. Most often whole brain homogenates are assessed obfuscating the known temporal and regional differneces in brain hormone present. Two analytical techniques, LC- and HPLC-inductively coupled plasma&ndash;mass spectrometry have recently been used to measure brain concentrations of TH. These techniques have proven capable of measuring very low levels in whole-body homogenates of frog tadpoles at different developmental stages (e.g., Simon et al., 2002; Tietge et al., 2010). The assay detects I&ndash;, MIT, DIT, T4, T3, and rT3. More recently, Wang and Stapleton (2010) and Donzelli et al. (2016) used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the simultaneous analysis of five THs including thyroxine (T4), 3,3&prime;,5-triidothyronine (T3), 3,3&prime;,5&prime;-triiodothyronine (rT3; reverse T3), 3,3&prime;-diiodothyronine (3,3&prime;-T2), and 3,5-diiodothyronine (3,5-T2) in serum and a variety of tissues including brain. These analytical methods require expensive equipment and technical expertise and as such are not routinely used.

The data published by Constantinou et al., (2005) determinedthe changes in the circulating thyroid hormone (TH) and brain synaptosomal TH content and&nbsp; the relative levels of mRNA encoding different thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms in adult rat brain. Region-specific quantitative differences in the expression pattern of all thyroid hormone receptor isoforms in euthyroid animals and hypothyroid animals were recorded and the obtained results show that in vivo depletion of TH regulates TR gene expression in adult rat brain in a region-specific manner (Constantinou et al., 2005).

	dcterms:description	"""All iodothyronines are derived from the modification of tyrosine molecules (Taurog, 2000). There are two biologically active thyroid hormones (THs) in serum, triiodothyronine (T3) and T4, and a few inactive iodothyronines (rT3, 3,5-T2). &nbsp;T4 is the predominant TH in circulation, comprising approximately 80% of the TH excreted from the thyroid gland and is the pool from which the majority of T3 in serum is generated (Zoeller et al., 2007). As such, serum T4 changes usually precede changes in other serum THs. &nbsp;Decreased thyroxine (T4) in serum results result from one or more MIEs upstream and is considered a key biomarker of altered TH homeostasis (DeVito et al., 1999; Chang et al., 2007).&nbsp;

Serum T4 is used as a biomarker of TH status because the circulatory system serves as the major transport and delivery system for TH delivery to tissues. The majority of THs in the blood are bound to transport proteins (Bartalena and Robbins, 1993). In serum, it is the unbound, or &lsquo;free&rsquo; form of the hormone that is thought to be available for transport into tissues. Free hormones are approximately 0.03 and 0.3 percent for T4 and T3, respectively. There are major species differences in the predominant binding proteins and their affinities for THs (see below). However, there is broad agreement that changes in serum concentrations of THs is diagnostic of thyroid disease or chemical-induced disruption of thyroid homeostasis (DeVito et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2009; Zoeller et al., 2007).

Normal serum T4 reference ranges can be species and lifestage specific. In rodents, serum THs are low in the fetal circulation, increasing as the fetal thyroid gland becomes functional on gestational day 17, just a few days prior to birth. After birth serum hormones increase steadily, peaking at two weeks, and falling slightly to adult levels by postnatal day 21 (Walker et al., 1980; Harris et al., 1978; Goldey et al., 1995; Lau et al., 2003). Similarly, in humans, adult reference ranges for THs do not reflect the normal ranges for children at different developmental stages, with TH concentrations highest in infants, still increased in childhood, prior to a decline to adult levels coincident with pubertal development (Corcoran et al. 1977; Kapelari et al., 2008). In some frog species, there is an analogous peak in thyroid hormones in tadpoles that starts around NF stage 56, peaks at Stage 62 and the declines to lower levels by Stage 56 (Sternberg et al., 2011; Leloup and Buscaglia, 1977).&nbsp;
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Serum T3 and T4 can be measured as free (unbound) or total (bound + unbound). Free hormone concentrations are clinically considered more direct indicators of T4 and T3 activities in the body, but in animal studies, total T3 and T4 are typically measured. Historically, the most widely used method in toxicology is radioimmunoassay (RIA). The method is routinely used in rodent endocrine and toxicity studies. The ELISA method is a commonly used as a human clinical test method. Analytical determination of iodothyronines (T3, T4, rT3, T2) and their conjugates, though methods employing HLPC, liquid chromatography, immuno luminescence, and mass spectrometry are less common, but are becoming increasingly available (Hornung et al., 2015; DeVito et al., 1999; Spencer, 2013).&nbsp; It is important to note that thyroid hormones concentrations can be influenced by a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., circadian rhythms, stress, food intake, housing, noise)&nbsp;(see for example, D&ouml;hler et al., 1979).

Any of these measurements should be evaluated for the relationship to the actual endpoint of interest, repeatability, reproducibility, and lower limits of quantification using a fit-for-purpose approach (i.e., different regulatory needs will require different levels of confidence in the AOP). This is of particular significance when assessing the very low levels of TH present in fetal serum. Detection limits of the assay must be compatible with the levels in the biological sample.&nbsp;&nbsp;All three of the methods summarized above would be fit-for-purpose, depending on the number of samples to be evaluated and the associated costs of each method. Both RIA and ELISA measure THs by an indirect methodology, whereas analytical determination is the most direct measurement available. All these methods, particularly RIA, are repeatable and reproducible.

Thyroxine-immunofluorescence quantitative disruption test (TIQDT) was designed to provide a simple, rapid, alternative bioassay for assessing the potential of chemical pollutants and drugs to disrupt thyroid gland function. Thyroid gland functionality was evaluated by
measuring IT4C in 4768 120 hpf zebrafish eleutheroembryos, following the TIQDT protocol (Thienpont et al., 2011).This study demonstrated that zebrafish eleutheroembryos provided a suitable vertebrate model, not only for screening the potential thyroid disrupting effect of molecules, but also for estimating the potential hazards associated with exposure to chemicals directly impairing thyroxine (T4) synthesis. Amitrole, potassium perchlorate, potassium thiocyanate, methimazole (MMI), phloroglucinol, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil, ethylenethiourea, benzophenone-2, resorcinol, pyrazole, sulfamethoxazole, sodium bromide, mancozeb, and genistein were classified as thyroid gland function disruptors. Concordance between TIQDT on zebrafish and mammalian published data was very high. TIQDT performed on zebrafish eleutheroembryos is an alternative whole-organism screening assay that provides relevant information for environmental and human risk assessments.

T4 can also be measured using immunoluminescence assay (Baret and Fert, 1989). The specific amplification (the xanthine oxidase dependent luminescence of luminol enhanced in the presence of Fe&ndash;EDTA complex) has been applied to T4 immunoassays, with T4&ndash;XO (xanthine oxidase). The performances of these assay is at least equivalent to those obtained with iodinated tracers, using the same solid phases and the same calibrators. The major advantages of these immunoassays are: (1) the long‚Äêterm signal which can be repeatedly recorded over several days, (2) the high detection sensitivity, (3) the long‚Äêterm stability of the luminescence reagent, and (4) the stability of the conjugates.

	dcterms:description	"""The hippocampus is a major brain region located in the medial temporal lobe in humans and other mammals (West, 1990). Developmentally it is derived from neuronal and glial cells in the neural tube and differentiates in the proencephalon and telencephalon.&nbsp; The hippocampus is a cortical structure, but only contains 3-layers, distinct from the 6-layered neocortical structures. For this reason, it is known as archicortex or paleocortex meaning old cortex. Within humans, the structure is identified as early as fetal week 13 and matures rapidly until 2 to 3 years of age (Kier et al 1997), with continuing slow growth thereafter until adult ages (Utsunomiya et al., 1999).&nbsp; In rodents, the hippocampus begins to form in midgestation, with the CA fields forming in advance of the dentate gyrus. Dentate gyrus forms in late gestation with most of its development occurring in the first 2-3 postnatal weeks (Altman and Bayer, 1990a; 1990b).

The structure of the hippocampus has been divided into regions that include CA1 through CA4 and the dentate gyrus. The principal cell bodies of the CA field are pyramidal neurons, those of the dentate gyrus are granule cells. The dentate gyrus forms later in development than the CA fields of the hippocampus. These regions are generally found in all mammalian hippocampi.

The major input pathway to the hippocampus is from the layer 2 neurons of the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus via the perforant path forming the first connection of the trisynaptic loop of the hippocampal circuit. Direct afferents from the dentate gyrus (mossy fibers) then synapse on CA3 pyramidal cells which in turn send their axons (Schaeffer Collaterals) to CA1 neurons to complete the trisynaptic circuit (Figure 1). From the CA fields information then passes through the subiculum entering the fiber pathways of the alveus, fimbria, and fornix and it routed to other areas of the brain (Amaral and Lavenex, 2006). Through the interconnectivity within the hippocampus and its connections to amygdala, septum and cortex, the hippocampus plays a pivotal role in several learning and memory processes, including spatial behaviors. The primary input pathway to the CA regions of the hippocampus is from the septum by way of the fornix and direct input from the amygdala. Reciprocal outputs from the hippocampus back to these regions and beyond also exist.

Subtle cytoarchitectural features depend on more specialized birth dating procedures and staining techniques. It is essential to consider the timing of events during development for detection to occur, as well as the timing for detection (Hevner, 2007; Garman et al., 2001; Zgraggen et al., 2012). Similar techniques used in rodent stydies have been applied to postmortem tissue in humans.

In humans, structural neuroimaging techniques are used to assess hippocampal volume with an analysis technique known as voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Volume of brain regions is measured by drawing regions of interest (ROIs) on images from brain scans obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) scans and calculating the volume enclosed. (Mechelli et al., 2005). Similar imaging techniques can be applied in rodent models (Powell et al., 2009; Hasegawa et al., 2010; Pirko et al., 2005; Pirko and Johnson, 2008).

	dcterms:description	"""The hippocampus functions as a highly integrated and organized communication and information processing network with millions of interconnections among its constitutive neurons. Neurons in the hippocampus and throughout the brain transmit and receive information largely through chemical transmission across the synaptic cleft, the space where the specialized ending of the presynaptic axon terminus of the transmitting neuron meets the specialized postsynaptic region of the neuron that is receiving that information (Kandell et al., 2012).

During development (see KE: Hippocampal anatomy, Altered), as neurons reach their final destination and extend axonal processes, early patterns of electrical synaptic activity emerge in the hippocampus. These are large fields of axonal innervation of broad synaptic target sites that are replaced by more elaborate but highly targeted and refined axonal projections brought about by activity-dependent synaptic pruning and synapse elimination.&nbsp; This is a classic case of the interaction between physiological and anatomical development, where anatomy develops first, and can be &lsquo;reshaped&rsquo; by physiological function (Kutsarova et al., 2017).

In the rat, excitatory processes are fully mature in area CA1 of hippocampus within 2 weeks of birth with inhibitory processes lagging begin by several weeks (Muller et al., 1989; Michelson and Lothman, 1988; Harris and Teyler, 1984). In hippocampal slices, inhibitory function in areaCA1s is first seen on postnatal day 5 and increases in strength at postnatal day 12 through 15.&nbsp; In vivo studies fail to detect inhibition until postnatal day 18 with steady increase thereafter to adult levels by postnatal day 28. Synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) is absent in the very young animal, only emerging about postnatal day 14, appearing to require the stability of both excitatory and inhibitory function to be established (Muller et al., 1989; Bekenstein and Lothman, 1991). These features of the maturation of hippocampal physiology are paralleled in dentate gyrus, but as with anatomical indices in the rat, the development of these physiological parameters lag behind the CA1 by about 1 week.
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""In animals, synaptic function in the hippocampus has been examined with imaging techniques, but more routinely, electrical field potentials recorded in two subregions of the hippocampus, area CA1 and dentate gyrus, have been assessed in vivo or in vitro from slices taken from naive or exposed animals. Field potentials reflect the summed synaptic response of a population of neurons following direct stimulation of input pathways across a monosynaptic connection. Changes in response amplitude due to chemical perturbations and other stressors&nbsp;(e.g., iodine deficiency, thyroidectomy, gene knockouts) is evidence of altered synaptic function. This can be measured in vitro, in vivo, or in hippocampal slices taken from treated animals (Gilbert and Burdette, 1995). The most common physiological measurements used to assess function of the hippocampus are excitatory synaptic transmission, inhibitory synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP).

Excitatory Synaptic Transmission: Two measures, the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and the population spike are derived from the compound field potential at increasing stimulus strengths. The function described by the relationship of current strength (input, I) and evoked response (output, O), the I-O curve is the measure of excitatory synaptic transmission (Gilbert and Burdette, 1995).

Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission: Pairs of stimulus pulses delivered in close temporal proximity is used to probe the integrity of inhibitory synaptic transmission. The response evoked by the second pulse of the pair at brief intervals (&lt;30 msec) arrives during the activation of feedback inhibitory loops in the hippocampus. An alteration in the degree of suppression to the 2nd pulse of the pair reflects altered inhibitory synaptic function (Gilbert and Burdette, 1995).

Long Term Potentiation (LTP): LTP is widely accepted to be a major component of the cellular processes that underlie learning and memory (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Bramham and Messaoudi, 2005). LTP represents, at the synapse and molecular level, the coincident firing of large numbers of neurons that are engaged during a learning event. The persistence of LTP emulates the duration of the memory. Synaptic plasticity in the form of LTP is assessed by delivering trains of high frequency stimulation to induce a prolonged augmentation of synaptic response. Probe stimuli at midrange stimulus strengths are delivered before and after application of LTP-inducing trains. The degree of increase in EPSP and PS amplitude to the probe stimulus after train application, and the duration of the induced synaptic enhancement are metrics of LTP. Additionally, contrasting I-O functions of excitatory synaptic transmission before and after (hours to days) LTP is induced is also a common measure of LTP maintanence (Bramham and Messaoudi, 2005; Kandell et al., 2012; Malenka and Bear, 2004).

Synaptic function in the human hippocampus has been assessed using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional neuroimaging techniques (Clapp et al., 2012). EEG is a measure of electrical activity over many brain regions but primarily from the cortex using small flat metal discs (electrodes) placed over the surface of the skull. It is a readily available test that provides evidence of how the brain functions over time. Functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI (fMRI) uses MRI technology to measure brain activity by detecting associated changes in blood flow. This technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technique that detects pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a radionuclide (tracer) injected into the body (Tietze, 2012; McCarthy, 1995). Like fMRI, PET scans indirectly measure blood flow to different parts of the brain &ndash; the higher the blood flow, the greater the activation (McCarthy, 1995). These techniques have been widely applied in clinical and research settings to assess learning and memory in humans and can provide information targeted to hippocampal functionality (McCarthy, 1995; Smith and Jonides, 1997; Willoughby et al., 2014; Wheeler et al., 2015; Gilbert et al., 1998).

Assays of this type are fit for purpose, have been well accepted in the literature, and are reproducible across laboratories. The assay directly measures the key event of altered neurophysiological function.

	dcterms:description	"""Thyroid hormones control genes in the developing brain by classical ligand (T3) activation of thyroid receptors which leads to DNA binding and subsequent transcription and translation &nbsp;(for a review of TH rols in brain development see, Bernal 2015). Gene expression profiles have been published for the developing human and rodent hippocampus (Zhang et al., 2002; Mody et al., 2001). In both humans and rodents, the hippocampus undergoes typical stages of neurodevelopment found in most brain regions, including: cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, synapse formation, and the maturation of synaptic function. In the rodent, peak windows during pre- and post-natal periods have been identified during which major cellular and physiological events occur (see Figure 1). Each window expresses distinct patterns of gene transcription and clusters of genes increase their expression corresponding to the progression of events of hippocampal ontogeny (see Mody et al., 2001).&nbsp; Tables of gene clusters associated with these phases can be found in Supplementary Tables of Mody et al. (2001).



&nbsp;

During the very early prenatal period, genes corresponding to general cellular function are prominent (Mody et al., 2001).&nbsp; These are followed in time by genes regulating neuronal differentiation and migration in the mid to late gestational period. From late gestation (gestational day 15) until birth almost all the cells in the CA fields switch from a highly active proliferation state to a postmitotic state, and undergo differentiation and migration. Expression of proliferative genes involved in cell cycle progression are highly expressed at gestational day 16, then subsequently are silent immediately after birth when genes directing neuronal growth switch on. The pyramidal neurons of the CA fields in the hippocampus proper develop in advance of the granule cells that comprise the principal cells of the dentate gyrus. As such, the genes controlling the distinct phases of neurodevelopment are expressed at different times in these two hippocampal subregions (Altman and Bayer, 1990a; b). In both subregions, however, many phenotypic changes within the hippocampal neuron occur in the period immediately after birth (postnatal day 1 to 7). Almost all neurons show extensive growth and differentiation during the first postnatal week. These cellular changes are marked by rapid cytoskeletal changes, production of cell adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix formation. The gene families involved in these processes include actins, tubulins, and chaperonin proteins essential for promoting correct protein folding of cytoskeletal components. Cell adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins are also upregulated during this period as these genes are critical for differentiation and synaptogenesis.

During late postnatal hippocampal development (postnatal day 16-30), hippocampal circuits become more active and exhibit increased synaptic plasticity. Many genes upregulated during this phase of development are involved in synaptic function and include genes regulating vesicle associated proteins and calcium-mediated transmitter release, neurotrophins, and neurotransmitter receptors. Efficient energy utilization is essential during this period of increased synaptic activity, events mirrored by an upregulation of enzymes involved in glucose and oxidative metabolism.

More commonly, quantitative rtPCR or in situ hybridization have been used to probe individual gene transcripts (Dowling et al., 2000, Morte et al., 2010) or their protein products (Alvarez-Dolado et al., 1994; Gilbert et al., 2007).

	dcterms:description	"""A paroxysmal depolarizing shift (PDS) or depolarizing shift is a cellular manifestation of epilepsy. As summarized by Lomen-Hoerth and Messing (2010), brain electrical activity is nonsynchronous under normal conditions. In epileptic seizures, a large group of neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner, which results in a wave of depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift (Somjen, 2004). Normally after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time, owing in part to the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine. However, in epilepsy the resistance of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased, likely due to changes in ion channels or inhibitory neurons not functioning properly. This then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop, known as a &quot;seizure focus&quot;.

Increased, abnormal neuron firing&nbsp;causes a wave of depolarization throughout the brain/neuronal tissue. At the level of single neurons, epileptiform activity consists of sustained neuronal depolarization resulting in a burst of action potentials, a plateau-like depolarization associated with completion of the action potential burst, and then a rapid repolarization followed by hyperpolarization. This sequence is also called paroxysmal depolarizing shift (PDS). The bursting activity resulting from the relatively prolonged depolarization of the neuronal membrane is due to influx of extracellular Ca2+, which leads to the opening of voltage-dependent Na+ channels, influx of Na+, and generation of repetitive action potentials. The subsequent hyperpolarizing afterpotential is mediated by iGABA receptors and Cl- influx, or by K+ efflux, depending on the cell type (Bromfield et al. 2006).

This may further lead to generalized seizure, convulsions and death (Bloomquist 2003; De Deyn et al. 1990; Werner and Covenas 2011). For instance, exposure to fipronil produces hyperexcitation at low doses and convulsion or tonic-clonic seizure and seizure-related death at high doses (Gunasekara et al. 2007; Tingle et al. 2003; Jackson et al. 2009).

As described in Bromfield et al. (2006), sizure propagation, the process by which a partial seizure spreads within the brain, occurs when there is sufficient activation to recruit surrounding neurons. This leads to a loss of surround inhibition and spread of seizure activity into contiguous areas via local cortical connections, and to more distant areas via long association pathways such as the corpus callosum. The propagation of bursting activity is normally prevented by intact hyperpolarization and a region of surrounding inhibition created by inhibitory neurons. With sufficient activation there is a recruitment of surrounding neurons via a number of mechanisms. Of equal interest, but less well understood, is the process by which seizures typically end, usually after seconds or minutes, and what underlies the failure of this spontaneous seizure termination in the life-threatening condition known as status epilepticus (Bromfield et al. 2006).

Shown is a common subtype &alpha;1&beta;2&gamma;2 of GABAA receptors found in the mammalian CNS. (A) Five subunits from three subunit subfamilies assemble to form a heteropentameric chloride permeable channel. (B) Stoichiometry and subunit arrangement of the GABAA receptor. Also shown are the binding sites for GABA and BZ. (C) Receptor subunits consist of four hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TM1-4), where TM2 is believed to line the pore of the channel. The large extracellular N-terminus is the site for ligand binding as well as the site of action of various drugs (e.g., picrotoxin and dieldrin). Each receptor subunit also contains a large intracellular domain between TM3 and TM4, which is the site for various protein&ndash;protein interactions as well as the site for post-translational modifications that modulate receptor activity. BZ: Benzodiazepines; CNS: Central nervous system; TM: Transmembrane.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As shown in Figure 1, binding of GABA opens up the chloride channel in the iGABAR complex, leading to neuronal inhibition (Olsen et al. 2004). Non-competitive channel blockers (e.g., fipronil, lindane, picrotoxin, penicillin and alpha-endosulfan) indirectly modulate the iGABAR activity (i.e., alter the response of the receptor to agonist) by noncompetitively binding at or near the central pore of the receptor complex (e.g., the picrotoxin site), an allosteric site distinct from that of the orthosteric agonist binding site, and inducing a conformational change within the receptor (Ernst et al. 2005; Johnston 2005).

Mounting evidence indicates that iGABAR chloride channel blockers bind to overlapping but not identical sites (Kalueff 2007). Based on the mapping of&nbsp;convulsants&#39; binding domains to the iGABAR chloride ionophore (Olsen 2006),&nbsp;Kalueff (2007) proposed&nbsp;a &quot;big picrotoxin binding pocket&quot; model for the ligand-binding area of ionophore. For instance,&nbsp;bicyclophosphates,&nbsp;butyrolactones, pentylenetetrazole&nbsp;and penicillin act on the N-terminus of TM2 (&lsquo;&lsquo;main&rsquo;&rsquo; picrotoxin binding site), whereas picrotoxin may act on the &quot;main&quot; as well as a hypothetical second &lsquo;&lsquo;allosteric&rsquo;&rsquo; picrotoxin site located on the C-terminus of TM2 (Kalueff 2007; Olsen 2006). In spite of minor differences, these blockers share&nbsp;similarity in channel blockage characteristics (e.g., voltage-dependency, binding to closed channel, reversible, and non-competitive) and effects of channel state (open/closed&nbsp;frequency and duration) (Kalueff 2007).&nbsp;Nevertheless, the 3D structure&nbsp;of iGABAR ionophore is unavailable. More homology modeling work (similar to the electron microscopic structure of nicotinic receptor channel (Unwin 2005)) may allow us to gain in-depth understanding of the picrotoxin&nbsp;site&#39;s accessibility for and interactions with channel blockers (i.e., convulsants),&nbsp;clarify the biological functions of the binding sites, and verify the impact of mutations in TM2 on ligand binding activity (Kalueff 2007).

	dcterms:description	"""In neuroscience, an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is defined as a neurotransmitter-induced postsynaptic potential change that depolarizes the cell, and hence increases the likelihood of initiating a postsynaptic action potential (Purves et al. 2001). On the contrary, an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) decreases this likelihood. Whether a postsynaptic response is an EPSP or an IPSP depends on the type of channel that is coupled to the receptor, and on the concentration of permeant ions inside and outside the cell. In fact, the only factor that distinguishes postsynaptic excitation from inhibition is the reversal potential of the postsynaptic potential (PSP) in relation to the threshold voltage for generating action potentials in the postsynaptic cell. When an active presynaptic cell releases neurotransmitters into the synapse, some of them bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell. Many of these receptors contain an ion channel capable of passing positively charged ions (e.g., Na+ or K+) or negatively charged ions (e.g., Cl-) either into or out of the cell. In epileptogenesis, discharges reduced GABAA receptor-mediated hyperpolarizing IPSPs by shifting their reversal potentials in a positive direction. At the same time, the amplitudes of Schaffer collateral-evoked RS-&alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor-mediated EPSPs and action potential-independent miniature EPSPs were enhanced, whereas N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated EPSPs remained unchanged.

	dcterms:description	"""Biological state: L-glutamate (Glu) is a neurotransmitter with important role in the regulation of brain development and maturation processes. Two major classes of Glu receptors, ionotropic and metabotropic, have been identified. Due to its physiological and pharmacological properties, Glu activates three classes of ionotropic receptors named: Œ±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid (AMPA receptors), 2-carboxy-3-carboxymethyl-4-isopropenylpyrrolidine (kainate receptors) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA receptors, NMDARs), which transduce the postsynaptic signal. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are integral membrane proteins formed by four large subunits that compose a central ion channel pore. In case of NMDA receptors, two NR1 subunits are combined with either two NR2 (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D) subunits and less commonly are assembled together with a combination of NR2 and NR3 (A, B) subunits (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010). 
To be activated NMDA receptors require simultaneous binding of both glutamate to NR2 subunits and of glycine to either NR1 or NR3 subunits that provide the specific binding sites named extracellular ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Apart from LBDs, NMDA receptor subunits contain three more domains that are considered semiautonomous: 1) the extracellular amino-terminal domain that plays important role in assembly and trafficking of these receptors; 2) the transmembrane domain that is linked with LBD and contributes to the formation of the core of the ion channel and 3) the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain that influences membrane targeting, stabilization, degradation and post-translation modifications.
Biological compartments: The genes of the NMDAR subunits are expressed in various tissues and are not only restricted to the nervous system. The level of expression of these receptors in neuronal and non-neuronal cells depends on: transcription, chromatin remodelling, mRNA levels, translation, stabilization of the protein, receptor assembly and trafficking, energy metabolism and numerous environmental stimuli (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010).
In hippocampus region of the brain, NR2A and NR2B are the most abundant NR2 family subunits. NR2A-containing NMDARs are mostly expressed synaptically, while NR2B-containing NMDARs are found both synaptically and extrasynaptically (Tovar and Westbrook, 1999).
General role in biology: NMDA receptors, when compared to the other Glu receptors, are characterized by higher affinity for Glu, slower activation and desensitisation kinetics, higher permeability for calcium (Ca2+) and susceptibility to potential-dependent blockage by magnesium ions (Mg2+). NMDA receptors are involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS).
Functions of NMDA receptors:
1. They are involved in cell signalling events converting environmental stimuli to genetic changes by regulating gene transcription and epigenetic modifications in neuronal cells (Cohen and Greenberg, 2008).
2. In NMDA receptors, the ion channel is blocked by extracellular Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions, allowing the flow of Na+ and Ca2+ ions into the cell and K+ out of the cell which is voltage-dependent. Ca2+ flux through the NMDA receptor is considered to play a critical role in pre- and post-synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism important for learning and memory (Barria and Malinow, 2002).
3. The NMDA receptors have been shown to play an essential role in the strengthening of synapses and neuronal differentiation, through long-term potentiation (LTP), and the weakening of synapses, through long-term depression (LTD). All these processes are implicated in the memory and learning function (Barria and Malinow, 2002).

No OECD methods are available to measure the activation state of NMDA receptors. 
The measurement of the activation or the inhibition of NMDA receptors is done indirectly by recording the individual ion channels that are selective to Na+, K+ and Ca+2 by the patch clamp technique. This method relies on lack of measurable ion flux when NMDA ion channel is closed, whereas constant channel specific conductance is recorded at the open state of the receptor (Blanke and VanDongen, 2009). Furthermore, this method is based on the prediction that activation or inhibition of an ion channel results from an increase in the probability of being in the open or close state, respectively.
The whole-cell patch clamp recording techniques have also been used to study synaptically-evoked NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs, respectively) in brain slices and neuronal cells, allowing the evaluation of the activated or inhibited state of the receptor (Ogdon and Stanfield, 2009; Zhao et al., 2009).
Microelectrode array (MEA) recordings are used to measure electrical activity in cultured neurons in response to NMDA receptor activation or inactivation (Keefer et al., 2001, Gramowski et al., 2000 and Gopal, 2003; Johnstone et al., 2010). MEAs can also be applied in higher throughput platforms to facilitate screening of numerous chemical compounds based on electrical activity measurements (McConnell et al., 2012).

	dcterms:alternative	"N/A, Neurodegeneration" ;
	dc:source	"AOPWiki" ;
	dcterms:description	"""The term neurodegeneration is a combination of two words - &quot;neuro,&quot; referring to nerve cells and &quot;degeneration,&quot; referring to progressive damage. The term &quot;neurodegeneration&quot; can be applied to several conditions that result in the loss of nerve structure and function, and neuronal loss by necrosis and/or apoptosis

Neurodegeneration is a key aspect of a large number of diseases that come under the umbrella of &ldquo;neurodegenerative diseases&quot; including Huntington&#39;s, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. All of these conditions lead to progressive brain damage and neurodegeneration.

Alzheimer&#39;s disease is characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions, with gross atrophy of the affected regions; symptoms include memory loss.

Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) results from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain substantia nigra pars compacta; symptoms include bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor.

Several observations suggest correlative links between environmental exposure and neurodegenerative diseases, but only few suggest causative links:

Only an extremely small proportion (less than 5%) of neurodegenerative diseases are caused by genetic mutations (Narayan and Dragounov, 2017). The remainders are thought to be caused by the following:

&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A build up of toxic proteins in the brain (Evin et al., 2006)

&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A loss of mitochondrial function that leads to the oxidative stress and creation of neurotoxic molecules that trigger cell death (apoptotic, necrotic or autophagy) (Cobley et al., 2018)

&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes in the levels and activities of neurotrophic factors (Kazim and Iqbal, 2016; Machado et al., 2016; Rodriguez et al., 2014)

&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Variations in the activity of neural networks (Greicius and Kimmel, 2012)

Protein aggregation: the correlation between neurodegenerative disease and protein aggregation in the brain has long been recognised, but a causal relationship has not been unequivocally established (Lansbury et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2016). The dynamic nature of protein aggregation mean that, despite progress in understanding its mechanisms, its relationship to disease is difficult to determine in the laboratory.

Nevertheless, drug candidates that inhibit aggregation are now being tested in the clinic. These have the potential to slow the progression of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, Parkinson&#39;s disease and related disorders and could, if administered pre-symptomatically, drastically reduce the incidence of these diseases.

Loss of mitochondrial function: many lines of evidence suggest that mitochondria have a central role in neurodegenerative diseases (Lin and Beal, 2006). Mitochondria are critical regulators of cell death, a key feature of neurodegeneration. Dysfunction of mitochondria induces oxidative stress, production of free radicals, calcium overload, and mutations in mitochondrial DNA that contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. In all major examples of these diseases there is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs early and acts causally in disease pathogenesis. Moreover, an impressive number of disease- specific proteins interact with mitochondria. Thus, therapies targeting basic mitochondrial processes, such as energy metabolism or free-radical generation, or specific interactions of disease-related proteins with mitochondria, hold great promise.

Decreased level of neurotrophic factors: decreased levels and activities of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), have been described in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington&#39;s disease, Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease (Zuccato and Cattaneo, 2009). These studies have led to the development of experimental strategies aimed at increasing BDNF levels in the brains of animals that have been genetically altered to mimic the aforementioned human diseases, with a view to ultimately influencing the clinical treatment of these conditions. Therefore BDNF treatment is being considered as a beneficial and feasible therapeutic approach in the clinic.

Variations in the activity of neural networks: Patients with various neurodegenerative disorders show remarkable fluctuations in neurological functions, even during the same day (Palop et al., 2006). These fluctuations cannot be caused by sudden loss or gain of nerve cells. Instead, it is likely that they reflect variations in the activity of neural networks and, perhaps, chronic intoxication by abnormal proteins that the brain is only temporarily able to overcome.

Recent neuropathological studies have shown that Fluoro-Jade, an anionic fluorescent dye, is a good marker of degenerating neurons. Fluoro-Jade and Fluoro-Jade B were found to stain all degenerating neurons, regardless of specific insult or mechanism of cell death (Schmued et al., 2005). More recently, Fluoro-Jade C was shown to be highly resistant to fading and compatible with virtually all histological processing and staining protocols (Schmued et al., 2005). In addition, Fluoro-Jade C is a good tool for detecting acutely and chronically degenerating neurons (Ehara and Ueda, 2009).

	dcterms:description	"""Biological state: Under physiological resting conditions of the cell, the free intracellular Ca2+ reaches around 100 nM, whereas the extracellular Ca2+ can be found at higher concentrations of 1.2 mM that under certain stimulus may invade the cell (Berridge et al, 2000). Six to seven oxygen atoms surround Ca2+, whereas the protein chelator of Ca2+ is the EF motif that is present in many proteins such as calmodulin (Clapham, 2007). The EF-hand is a helix-loop-helix calcium-binding motif in which two helices pack together at an angle of approximately 90 degrees (Lewit-Bentley and R&eacute;ty, 2000). The two helices are separated by a loop region where calcium actually binds. The EF notation for the motif is derived from the notation applied to the structure of parvalbumin, in which the E and F helices were originally identified as forming this calcium-binding motif.

Biological compartments: Ca2+ ions accumulate in the cytoplasm, cellular organelles (e.g. mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum) and nucleus in response to diverse classes of stimuli.

General role in biology: In order to adapt to altered stimulus from exposure to different environmental factors, cells require signal transmission. However, signalling needs messengers whose concentration is modified upon stimulus (Clapham, 2007). Ca2+ ions act as an important intracellular messenger playing the role of ubiquitous signalling molecules and consequently regulate many different cellular functions (Berridge, 2012; Hagenston and Bading, 2011). Given its important role in processes that are fundamental to all cell types, Ca2+ homeostasis is tightly regulated by intracellular and extracellular mechanisms (Barhoumi et al., 2010). Intracellular Ca2+ concentration is regulated by opening or closing channels in the plasma membrane. Additionally, the Ca2+ ions can be released from intracellular stores of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through ryanodine receptors (RYRs) or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs). Ca2+ homeostasis is also regulated by the mechanisms that remove Ca2+ from the cytosol, for example pumps in both cell membrane and ER membrane. In addition, cytosolic Ca2+ regulation involves accumulation of Ca2+ in mitochondria that have the capacity to buffer the excess of cytoplasmic Ca2+ ions. In neurons, Ca2+ ions regulate many critical functions. Firstly, they contribute to dendritic electrical signalling, producing postsynaptic depolarization by the current carried by Ca2+ ions. Secondly, Ca2+ activates Ca2+-sensitive proteins such as different kinases, calcineurin and calpain, triggering signalling pathways critical for cell physiology. Modification of the gene transcription is the final outcome of the Ca2+ ions impact on long-term modifications affecting neurotransmitters release (reviewed in Neher and Sakaba, 2008), neuronal differentiation, synapse function and cell viability (Clapham, 2007; Higley and Sabatini, 2012). Thus, the Ca2+ that enters and accumulates in cytoplasm and nucleus is a central signalling molecule that regulates synapse and neuronal cell function, including learning and memory processes (Berridge, 2012; Hagenston and Bading, 2011).

No OECD method is available to measure intracellular Ca2+.

The gold standard method for measuring Ca2+ current through NMDA receptor is patch clamp electrophysiology (Blanke and VanDongen, 2009).

In vitro, well-established flow cytometric or high content imaging analysis with specific fluorescent dyes (Ca2+-sensitive fluorophores) such as Fura-2, Oregon Green-BAPTA, Fluo-4 and X-Rhod exist for determination of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The use of different fluorometric calcium indicators in neuroscience and neurotoxicology have been recently reviewed by Grienberger and Konnerth (2012) and Calvo et al (2015).

Barhoumi et al. 2010 summarised all the methods to measure cytosolic Ca2+ alterations due to exposure to neurotoxic compounds, including steady state, short-term kinetic measurements of stimulated Ca2+ transients and dynamic measurements. This paper further discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in intracellular Ca2+ measurements and its applicability in high throughput screening.

For quantitative estimation of Ca2+ in dendritic spines, besides of Ca2+-sensitive fluorophores the use of two-photon released caged neurotransmitters has been suggested as it allows direct stimulation of visualized spines (Higley and Sabatini, 2012). In Higley and Sabatini 2012 further technical information can be found in relation to study Ca2+ in dendritic spines.

Furthermore, there are three methods for measuring Ca2+ influx in NMDA receptors that involve the measurement of 1) relative Ca2+ permeability, 2) channel blockage by Ca2+, and 3) fractional Ca2+ currents from whole-cell currents determined in the presence of high concentrations of intracellular Fura-2 (Traynelis et al., 2010).

In vivo, two-photon Ca2+ imaging using Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicators that measure changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration as a readout for suprathreshold and subthreshold neuronal activity has also been used to study learning and memory in live rodents (Chen et al., 2013) The last two decades the neuronal function of the larval and adult zebrafish has been extensively studied using Ca2+ imaging methods. By applying simple Ca2+ indicators such as dextran or acetoxymethyl esters to more powerful genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators, zebrafish provides a transparent model where live Ca2+ imaging can be successfully achieved (Kettunen, 2012).

Fluorescent Ca2+ indicators have been also used as Pb2+ sensors in order to resolve spatiotemporal changes in intracellular Pb2+ in relation to cellular signaling and intracellular divalent metal homeostasis (Vijveberg and Westerink, 2012).

Intra-cellular calcium concentration can be measured in cell cultures with the calcium sensitive fluorescent dye Fura-2 AM and fluorescence microscopy. This technique appeared to be more sensitive than the plate-reader based assay Meijer et al., 2014).

Two major classes of Glu receptors, ionotropic and metabotropic, have been identified. Due to its physiological and pharmacological properties, Glu activates three classes of ionotropic receptors named: &alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid (AMPA receptors), 2-carboxy-3-carboxymethyl-4-isopropenylpyrrolidine (kainate receptors) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA receptors, NMDARs), which transduce the postsynaptic signal.

Is the assay reproducible?  There is no OECD advised method for measuring NMDA receptor binding of antagonists. However, there are methods described in the scientific literature that allow measuring:

1. Ex vivo: The most common assay used is the NMDA receptor (MK801 site) radioligand competition binding assays (Reynolds, 2001; Gao et al., 2013; http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/UNC-CH%20Protocol%20Book.pdf; http://www.currentprotocols.com/WileyCDA/CPUnit/refId-ph0120.html). This assay is based on the use of the most potent and specific antagonist of this receptor, MK801 that is used to detect and differentiate agonists and antagonists (competitive and non-competitive) that bind to this specific site of the receptor. Also radioligand competition binding assay can be performed using D, L-(E)-2-amino-4-[3H]-propyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid ([3H]-CGP 39653), a high affinity selective antagonist at the glutamate site of NMDA receptor, which is a quantitative autoradiography technique (Mugnaini et al., 1996). D-AP5, a selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that competitively inhibits the glutamate binding site of NMDA receptors, can be studied by evoked electrical activity measurements. AP5 has been widely used to study the activity of NMDA receptors particularly with regard to researching synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Evans et al.,1982; Morris, 1989).

2. In silico: The prediction of NMDA receptor targeting is achievable by combining database mining, molecular docking, structure-based pharmacophore searching, and chemical similarity searching methods together (Korkut and Varnali, 2003; Koutsoukos et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2013; Mazumder and Borah, 2014; Chtitaa et al., 2015).

	dcterms:alternative	"BDNF, Reduced" ;
	dc:source	"AOPWiki" ;
	dcterms:description	"""Biological state: BDNF belongs to a family of closely related neurotrophic factors named neurotrophins and is widely expressed in the developing and mature CNS. In the rodent cortex, postnatal BDNF expression is initially low but slowly increases to reach high levels around weaning. Therefore, BDNF expression peaks at a time when both structural and functional maturation of cortical circuitry occurs. During postnatal development, BDNF levels are dynamically regulated, in part by neuronal activity dependent mechanisms (Waterhouse and Xu, 2009). Glutamate has been shown to increase the transcription and release of BDNF. Indeed, BDNF is synthesized, stored and released from glutamatergic neurons (Lessmann et al., 2003).

Biological compartments: BDNF initially is synthesized as precursor proteins (proBDNF), which is processed intracellularly to be transformed in its mature form (mBDNF) after proteolytically cleaved in the synaptic cleft by plasmin which is a protease activated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (Cohen-Cory et al., 2010). proBDNF is constantly secreted while tPA release and mBDNF production depends on neuronal excitation (Head et al., 2009). Storage and activity-dependent release of BDNF has been demonstrated in both dendrites and axon terminals (Waterhouse and Xu, 2009). More specifically, in hippocampus, BDNF appears to be stored in dendritic processes of neurons (Balkowiec and Katz, 2002). BDNF is abundant in cerebellum and cortex and has also been measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Zhang et al., 2008), whole blood, plasma, serum (plasma without clotting factors) and platelets (Trajkovska et al., 2007). BDNF has been found to be produced by astrocytes under both physiological and pathological conditions (Endo, 2005; Coco et al., 2013; Nelson and Alkon, 2014).

In humans (Pruunsild et al., 2007), mBDNF is sequestered in platelets, consequently BDNF can reach all tissues and organs. Lymphocytic cells have been shown to express BDNF in vitro similarly to eosinophils, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells. The visceral and airway epithelium are also significant sources of BDNF. Female reproductive system including ovaries, placenta and uterus also express BDNF (Wessels et al., 2014).

General role in biology: The biological functions of mBDNF are mediated by binding to tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) receptor that leads to the activation of three major intracellular signalling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K and PLC&gamma;1 (Soul&eacute; et al., 2006). TrkB-mediated signaling regulates gene transcription in the nucleus through the activation of several transcription factors. These genes are involved in neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, synapse maturation and stabilization (Pang et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2005; Nelson and Alkon, 2014).

On the other hand, proBDNF binds to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and activates RhoA, a small GTPase that regulates actin cytoskeleton polymerization leading to inhibition of axonal elongation, growth cone collapse, and apoptosis (Dubreuil et al., 2003; Yamauchi et al., 2004; Head et al., 2009).

No OECD methods are available to measure BDNF protein and mRNA levels. Measuring BDNF levels changes in the brain, especially when low, at the boarder to be significant are technically difficult. Depending on the tissue or fluid measurements distinct methods are used.

Brain tissue: BDNF protein levels can be measured by commercial available antibody sandwich ELISA kits, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. BDNF primers for different exons are available to determine mRNA levels by RT-PCR. The Bdnf gene consists of multiple alternative exons (ten in human, eight in rodents and six in lower vertebrates), and a single exon coding for the entire pro-BDNF protein (Cohen-Cory et al., 2010).

Cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF): There are available commercial antibody sandwich ELISA kits (Trajkovska et al., 2007) and immunobead-based multiplex assays for high throughput screening (Zhang et al., 2008).

Whole blood, serum, plasma and platelets: There are several commercial double antibody sandwich ELISA kits that can be used for identification of BDNF levels in biological fluids (Trajkovska et al., 2007).

Methodological considerations that have to be taken into account during sample preparation and measurement of BDNF by ELISA have been recently reviewed in Elfving et al. 2010. A study measuring BDNF by a commercially available ELISA kit in various tissues and biological liquids derived from distinct species revealed that BDNF is undetectable in mouse blood and pig plasma (Klein et al., 2011). This study also showed that in most cases BDNF levels are comparable to levels reported in humans and that there is positive correlation between blood BDNF levels and hippocampal BDNF levels in rats and pigs (Klein et al., 2011).

	dcterms:description	"""Two types of cell death can be distinguished by morphological features, although it is likely that these are two ends of a spectrum with possible intermediate forms. Apoptosis involves shrinkage, nuclear disassembly, and fragmentation of the cell into discrete bodies with intact plasma membranes. These are rapidly phagocytosed by neighbouring cells. An important feature of apoptosis is the requirement for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to initiate the execution phase. In contrast, necrotic cell death is characterized by cell swelling and lysis. This is usually a consequence of profound loss of mitochondrial function and resultant ATP depletion, leading to loss of ion homeostasis, including volume regulation, and increased Ca2+. The latter activates a number of nonspecific hydrolases (i.e., proteases, nucleases, and phospholipases) as well as calcium dependent kinases. Activation of calpain I, the Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease cleaves the death-promoting Bcl-2 family members Bid and Bax which translocate to mitochondrial membranes, resulting in release of truncated apoptosis-inducing factor (tAIF), cytochrome c and endonuclease in the case of Bid and cytocrome c in the case of Bax. tAIF translocates to cell nuclei, and together with cyclophilin A and phosphorylated histone H2AX (&gamma;H2AX) is responsible for DNA cleavage, a feature of programmed necrosis. Activated calpain I has also been shown to cleave the plasma membrane Na+&ndash;Ca2+ exchanger, which leads to build-up of intracellular Ca2+, which is the source of additional increased intracellular Ca2+. Cytochrome c in cellular apoptosis is a component of the apoptosome.

DNA damage activates nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1(PARP-1), a DNA repair enzyme. PARP-1 forms poly(ADP-ribose) polymers, to repair DNA, but when DNA damage is extensive, PAR accumulates, exits cell nuclei and travels to mitochondrial membranes, where it, like calpain I, is involved in AIF release from mitochondria. A fundamental distinction between necrosis and apoptosis is the loss of plasma membrane integrity; this is integral to the former but not the latter. As a consequence, lytic release of cellular constituents promotes a local inflammatory reaction, whereas the rapid removal of apoptotic bodies minimizes such a reaction. The distinction between the two modes of death is easily accomplished in vitro but not in vivo. Thus, although claims that certain drugs induce apoptosis have been made, these are relatively unconvincing. DNA fragmentation can occur in necrosis, leading to positive TUNEL staining. Conversely, when apoptosis is massive, it can exceed the capacity for rapid phagocytosis, resulting in the eventual appearance of secondary necrosis.

Two alternative pathways - either extrinsic (receptor-mediated) or intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) - lead to apoptotic cell death. The initiation of cell death begins either at the plasma membrane with the binding of TNF or FasL to their cognate receptors or within the cell. The latter is due to the occurrence of intracellular stress in the form of biochemical events such as oxidative stress, redox changes, covalent binding, lipid peroxidation, and consequent functional effects on mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, microtubules, cytoskeleton, or DNA. The intrinsic mitochondrial pathway involves the initiator, caspase-9, which, when activated, forms an &ldquo;apoptosome&rdquo; in the cytosol, together with cytochrome c, which translocates from mitochondria, Apaf-1 and dATP. The apoptosome activates caspase-3, the central effector caspase, which in turn activates downstream factors that are responsible for the apoptotic death of a cell [1]. Intracellular stress either directly affects mitochondria or can lead to effects on other organelles, which then send signals to the mitochondria to recruit participation in the death process [1][2]Constitutively expressed nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is a Ca2+-dependent cytosolic enzyme that forms nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine, and NO reacts with the free radical such as superoxide (O2&minus;) to form the very toxic free radical peroxynitrite (ONOO&minus;). Free radicals such as ONOO&minus;, O2 &minus; and hydroxyl radical (OH&minus;) damage cellular membranes and intracellular proteins, enzymes and DNA [1], [2] [3][4]

LDH is a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme that is present in almost all cells and is released into extracellular space when the plasma membrane is damaged. To detect the leakage of LDH into cell culture medium, a tetrazolium salt is used in this assay. In the first step, LDH produces reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) when it catalyzes the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate. In the second step, a tetrazolium salt is converted to a colored formazan product using newly synthesized NADH in the presence of an electron acceptor. The amount of formazan product can be colorimetrically quantified by standard spectroscopy. Because of the linearity of the assay, it can be used to enumerate the percentage of necrotic cells in a sample. [5]

The MTT assay is a colorimetric assay for assessing cell viability. NAD(P)H-dependent cellular oxidoreductase enzymes may reflect the number of viable cells present. These enzymes are capable of reducing the tetrazolium dye MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to its insoluble formazan, which has a purple color. Other closely related tetrazolium dyes including XTT, MTS and the WSTs. Tetrazolium dye assays can also be used to measure cytotoxicity (loss of viable cells) or cytostatic activity (shift from proliferation to quiescence) of potential medicinal agents and toxic materials. MTT assays are usually done in the dark since the MTT reagent is sensitive to light [6].

Propidium iodide (PI) is an intercalating agent and a fluorescent molecule used to stain necrotic cells. It is cell membrane impermeant so it stains only those cells where the cell membrane is destroyed. When PI is bound to nucleic acids, the fluorescence excitation maximum is 535 nm and the emission maximum is 617 nm [7] .

Alamar Blue (resazurin) fluorescent dye. The oxidized blue non fluorescent Alamar blue is reduced to a pink fluorescent dye in the medium by cell activity (O&#39;Brien et al., 2000) (12).

Neutral red uptake, which is based on the ability of viable cells to incorporate and bind the supravital dye neutral red in lysosomes (Repetto et al., 2008)(13).

ATP assay: Quantification of ATP, signaling the presence of metabolically active cells (CellTiter-Glo; Promega).


Apoptosis:

TUNEL is a common method for detecting DNA fragmentation that results from apoptotic signalling cascades. The assay relies on the presence of nicks in the DNA which can be identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase or TdT, an enzyme that will catalyze the addition of dUTPs that are secondarily labeled with a marker. It may also label cells that have suffered severe DNA damage.

Caspase activity assays measured by fluorescence. During apoptosis, mainly caspase-3 and -7 cleave PARP to yield an 85 kDa and a 25 kDa fragment. PARP cleavage is considered to be one of the classical characteristics of apoptosis. Antibodies to the 85 kDa fragment of cleaved PARP or to caspase-3 both serve as markers for apoptotic cells that can be monitored using immunofluorescence [8].

Hoechst 33342 staining: Hoechst dyes are cell-permeable and bind to DNA in live or fixed cells. Therefore, these stains are often called supravital, which means that cells survive a treatment with these compounds. The stained, condensed or fragmented DNA is a marker of apoptosis. [9] [10]

Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide staining is used to visualize nuclear changes and apoptotic body formation that are characteristic of apoptosis. Cells are viewed under a fluorescence microscope and counted to quantify apoptosis.

	dcterms:description	"""&nbsp;

Learning can be defined as the process by which new information is acquired to establish knowledge by systematic study or by trial and error (Ono, 2009). Two types of learning are considered in neurobehavioral studies: a) associative learning and b) non-associative learning. Associative learning is based on making associations between different events. In associative learning, a subject learns the relationship among two different stimuli or between the stimulus and the subject&rsquo;s behaviour. On the other hand, non-associative learning can be defined as an alteration in the behavioural response that occurs over time in response to a single type of stimulus. Habituation and sensitization are some examples of non-associative learning.

The memory formation requires acquisition, retention and retrieval of information in the brain, which is characterised by the non-conscious recall of information (Ono, 2009). There are three main categories of memory, including sensory memory, short-term or working memory (up to a few hours) and long-term memory (up to several days or even much longer).

Learning and memory depend upon the coordinated action of different brain regions and neurotransmitter systems constituting functionally integrated neural networks (D&rsquo;Hooge and DeDeyn, 2001). Among the many brain areas engaged in the acquisition of, or retrieval of, a learned event, the hippocampal-based memory systems have received the most study. For example, the hippocampus has been shown to be critical for spatial-temporal memory, visio-spatial memory, verbal and narrative memory, and episodic and autobiographical memory (Burgess et al., 2000; Vorhees and Williams, 2014). However, there is substantial evidence that fundamental learning and memory functions are not mediated by the hippocampus alone but require a network that includes, in addition to the hippocampus, anterior thalamic nuclei, mammillary bodies cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia (Aggleton and Brown, 1999; Doya, 2000; Mitchell et al., 2002, Toscano and Guilarte, 2005; Gilbert et al., 2006, 2016). Thus, damage to variety of brain structures can potentially lead to impairment of learning and memory. The main learning areas and pathways are similar in rodents and primates, including man (Eichenbaum, 2000; Stanton and Spear, 1990).While the prefrontal cortex and frontostriatal neuronal circuits have been identified as the primary sites of higher-order cognition in vertebrates, invertebrates utilize paired mushroom bodies, shown to contain ~300,000 neurons in honey bees (Menzel, 2012; Puig et al., 2014).

For the purposes of this KE (AO), impaired learning and memory is defined as an organism&rsquo;s inability to establish new associative or non-associative relationships, or sensory, short-term or long-term memories which can be measured using different behavioural tests described below.
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""In laboratory animals: in rodents, a variety of tests of learning and memory have been used to probe the integrity of hippocampal function. These include tests of spatial learning like the radial arm maze (RAM), the Barnes maze, passive avoidance and Spontaneous alternation and most commonly, the Morris water maze (MWM). Test of novelty such as novel object recognition, and fear based context learning are also sensitive to hippocampal disruption. Finally, trace fear conditioning which incorporates a temporal component upon traditional amygdala-based fear learning engages the hippocampus. A brief description of these tasks follows.

1) RAM, Barnes, MWM are examples of spatial tasks, animals are required to learn the location of a food reward (RAM); an escape hole to enter a preferred dark tunnel from a brightly lit open field area (Barnes maze), or a hidden platform submerged below the surface of the water in a large tank of water (MWM) (Vorhees and Williams, 2014).

2) Novel Object recognition. This is a simpler task that can be used to probe recognition memory. Two objects are presented to animal in an open field on trial 1, and these are explored. On trial 2, one object is replaced with a novel object and time spent interacting with the novel object is taken evidence of memory retention &ndash; I have seen one of these objects before, but not this one (Cohen and Stackman, 2015).

3) Contextual Fear conditioning is a hippocampal based learning task in which animals are placed in a novel environment and allowed to explore for several minutes before delivery of an aversive stimulus, typically a mild foot shock. Upon reintroduction to this same environment in the future (typically 24-48 hours after original training), animals will limit their exploration, the context of this chamber being associated with an aversive event. The degree of suppression of activity after training is taken as evidence of retention, i.e., memory (Curzon et al., 2009).

4) Trace fear conditioning. Standard fear conditioning paradigms require animals to make an association between a neutral conditioning stimulus (CS, a light or a tone) and an aversive stimulus (US, a footshock). The unconditioned response (CR) that is elicited upon delivery of the footshock US is freezing behavior. With repetition of CS/US delivery, the previously neutral stimulus comes to elicit the freezing response. This type of learning is dependent on the amygdala, a brain region associated with, but distinct from the hippocampus. Introducing a brief delay between presentation of the neutral CS and the aversive US, a trace period, requires the engagement of the amygdala and the hippocampus (Shors et al., 2001).

In humans:&nbsp; A variety of standardized learning and memory tests have been developed for human neuropsychological testing, including children (Rohlman et al., 2008). These include episodic autobiographical memory, perceptual motor tests, short and&nbsp; long term memory tests, working memory tasks, word pair recognition memory; object location recognition memory. Some have been incorporated in general tests of intelligence (IQ) such as the WAIS and the Wechsler. Modifications have been made and norms developed for incorporating of tests of learning and memory in children. Examples of some of these tests include:

1) Rey Osterieth Complex Figure (RCFT) which probes a variety of functions including as visuospatial abilities, memory, attention, planning, and working memory (Shin et al., 2006).

2) Children&rsquo;s Auditory Verbal Learning Test (CAVLT) is a free recall of presented word lists that yields measures of Immediate Memory Span, Level of Learning, Immediate Recall, Delayed Recall, Recognition Accuracy, and Total Intrusions. (Lezak 1994; Talley, 1986).

3) Continuous Visual Memory Test (CVMT) measures visual learning and memory. It is a free recall of presented pictures/objects rather than words but that yields similar measures of Immediate Memory Span, Level of Learning, Immediate Recall, Delayed Recall, Recognition Accuracy, and Total Intrusions. (Lezak, 1984; 1994).

4) Story Recall from Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) Logical Memory Test Battery, a standardized neurospychological test designed to measure memory functions (Lezak, 1994; Talley, 1986).

5) Autobiographical memory (AM) is the recollection of specific personal events in a multifaceted higher order cognitive process. It includes episodic memory- remembering of past events specific in time and place, in contrast to semantic autobiographical memory is the recollection of personal facts, traits, and general knowledge. Episodic AM is associated with greater activation of the hippocampus and a later and more gradual developmental trajectory. Absence of episodic memory in early life (infantile amnesia) is thought to reflect immature hippocampal function (Herold et al., 2015; Fivush, 2011).

6) Staged Autobiographical Memory Task. In this version of the AM test, children participate in a staged event involving a tour of the hospital, perform a series of tasks (counting footprints in the hall, identifying objects in wall display, buy lunch, watched a video). It is designed to contain unique event happenings, place, time, visual/sensory/perceptual details. Four to five months later, interviews are conducted using Children&rsquo;s Autobiographical Interview and scored according to standardized scheme (Willoughby et al., 2014).

In Honey Bees: Text from LaLone et al. (2017) Weight of evidence evaluation of a network of adverse outcome pathways linking activaiton of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in honey bees to colony death. Science of the Total Environment 584-585, 751-775: &quot;For over 50 years an assay for evaluating olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) has been used as a reliablemethod for evaluating appetitive learning and memory in honey bees (Guirfa and Sandoz, 2012). These experiments pair a conditioned stimulus (e.g., an odor) with an unconditioned stimulus (e.g., sucrose) provided immediately afterward, which elicits the proboscis extension (Menzel, 2012). After conditioning, the odor alone will lead to the conditioned PER. Thismethodology has aided in the elucidation of five types of olfactory memory phases in honey bee, which include early short-term memory, late short-term memory, mid-term memory, early long-term memory, and late long-term memory (Guirfa and Sandoz, 2012). These phases are dependent on the type of conditioned stimulus, the intensity of the unconditioned stimulus, the number of conditioning trials,
and the time between trials. Where formation of short-term memory occurs minutes after conditioning and decays within minutes, memory consolidation or stabilization of a memory trace after initial acquisition leads to mid-term memory, which lasts 1 d and is characterized by activity of the cAMP-dependent PKA (Guirfa and Sandoz, 2012). Multiple conditioning trials increase the duration of the memory after learning and coincide with increased Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent PKC activity (Guirfa and Sandoz, 2012). Early long-term memory, where a conditioned response can be evoked days to weeks after conditioning requires translation of existing mRNA, whereas late long-term memory requires de novo gene transcription and can last for weeks (Guirfa andSandoz, 2012).&quot;

	dc:source	"AOPWiki" ;
	dcterms:description	"""Biological state: After becoming post-mitotic and during the differentiation process, neuronal cells undergo lengthening, branching, dendrite and dendritic spine formation (Scott and Luo, 2001). In human, dendrites appear as early as 13.5 weeks gestation in the subplate neurons while arborization begins only after 26 weeks (Mrzljak et al., 1988 and Mrzljak et al., 1990). In rodents, during the first postnatal week, both pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons go through extensive and fast dendrite growth, branching, and elaboration. Dendrite arbor's capacity and complexity continue to increase in the second and third postnatal week, however, much slower. During the same developmental window, dendritic spines begin to appear as a group. The first spines look like filopodia (Dailey and Smith, 1996; Fiala et al., 1998). Filopodia can grow and retract within seconds to minutes, permitting them to explore and identify appropriate presynaptic targets (Dailey and Smith, 1996). As dendrite spines mature, these long and thin structures change and the spines shorten and acquire a bulbous ending or ‚Äòhead‚Äô (Dailey and Smith, 1996). At this final stage of dendrite growth, a neuron possesses a dynamic dendrite tree, which has a greater potential for connectivity and synapse creation because of dendritic spine formation. 
Biological compartments: Dendritic morphology determines many aspects of neuronal function, including action potential propagation and information processing. Postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), a protein involved in dendritic spine maturation and clustering of synaptic signalling proteins, plays a critical role in regulating dendrite outgrowth and branching, independent of its synaptic functions. In immature neurons, over-expression of PSD-95 decreases the proportion of primary dendrites that undergo additional branching, resulting in a marked reduction of secondary dendrite number. Conversely, knocking down PSD-95 protein in immature neurons increases secondary dendrite number. Binding of cypin to PSD-95 (that regulates PSD-95 location) correlates with formation of stable dendrite branches. Finally, overexpression of PSD-95 in COS-7 cells disrupts microtubule organization, indicating that PSD-95 may modulate microtubules to regulate dendritic branching. Proteins primarily involved in synaptic functions can also play developmental roles in shaping how a neuron patterns its dendrite branches (Kornau et al., 1995).
New spines containing PSDs are formed by conversion of dynamic filopodia-like spine precursors in which PSDs appeared de novo, or by direct extension of spines or spine precursors carrying preformed PSDs from the shaft. PSDs are therefore highly dynamic structures that can undergo rapid structural alteration within dendrite shafts, spines and spine precursors, permitting rapid formation and re-modelling of synaptic connections in developing CNS tissues. 
Dendritic spines are important sites of excitatory synaptic transmission and changes in the strength of these synapses are likely to underlie important higher brain functions such as learning and memory. Spines form biochemical compartments for isolating reactions that occur at one synapse from those at other synapses thereby providing a possible way to ensure the specificity of connections between neurons in the brain.
The stages of dendrite development have been clearly described in neurons located in the developing rodent cortex and hippocampus (Dailey and Smith, 1996; Fiala et al., 1998; Redmond, 2008) and human prefrontal cortex (Mrzljak et al., 1988; Mrzljak et al., 1990).
General role in biology: Functionally, dendrites serve as post-synaptic part of a synapse, playing a critical role in the processing of information transmitted through synapses. They receive the majority of synaptic inputs comparing to the soma or the axon. Consequently, it is not surprising that postsynaptic activity is closely related to the properties of the dendritic arbor itself, implying that the dendrites strongly influence and control synaptic transmission and plasticity (Sj√∂str√∂m et al., 2008).

Elaboration of dendritic processes is measured from electron and fluorescent micrographs. These processes are identified primarily by the presence of microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and the absence of components characteristic of axons and glia (e.g. small vesicles, myelin, glial filaments).These measurements can also be carried out by automated imaging systems in cells prepared for immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies that recognise MAP-2 (Harrill and Mundy, 2011).
Two-photon time-lapse images can be used to visualise dendrites in GFP-transfected neurons, whereas Golgi Stain Kit is used to measure both dendrites and dendritic spines. A combination of Golgi-Cox and immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy has also been suggested for the visualisation of dendrites in brain slices derived either from rodents or non-human primates (Levine et al., 2013).
The morphological analysis of neurons, include the use of fluorescent markers, such as DiI (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate) that permits not only the visualisation of detailed dendritic arborizations and spines in cell culture and tissue sections but also permits the quantitative analysis of dendritic spines (Cheng et al., 2014).
Fluorescent labelling for MARCM (mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker) system can also be used but only in case of transparent larval body wall found in Drosophila.

	dcterms:alternative	"Synaptogenesis, Decreased " ;
	dc:source	"AOPWiki" ;
	dcterms:description	"""Biological state: Synaptogenesis is a multi-step process that is crucial for brain development and involves the formation of synapses. It follows axonal migration, at which stage presynaptic and postsynaptic differentiation occurs (Garner et al., 2002). &quot;Synaptic assembly&quot; that refers to the gathering of the appropriate components and &quot;synaptic formation&quot; that is defined by the mechanisms involved in recruitment of molecules required for differentiation, stabilization and maturation of synapse, are the main phases that characterise synaptogenesis (Col&oacute;n-Ramos, 2009). Elimination is a physiological step involved in synaptogenesis regarding the synapses that fail to get stabilised and mature.

The first step is the recognition and the establishment of contact between an axon and a dendritic spine in which pre- and postsynaptic neurons play important role. The presynaptic differentiation occurs followed by excretion of neurotransmitters that bind to appropriate receptors located on the target spine. However, a postsynaptic neuron does not passively receive guidance from a presynaptic axon but are the same dendritic filopodia that gradually are transformed into spines that select and engage their presynaptic neurons. The transformation of dendritic filopodia into dendritic spines that involves the expression of the whole postsynaptic machinery such as postsynaptic density (PSD), receptor subunits, scaffolding proteins and actin cytoskeleton, is the first step to give nascent synapses. However, to become functional and mature these synapses need an important number of cell-cell interactions, including stimulation from glutamatergic synapses as well as the influence of neurotrophic factors (Munno and Syed, 2003).

However, all this is true for glutamatergic synapses because GABAergic synapses do not appear in dendritic spines, but rather form on dendritic shafts, nerve cell somata and axon initial segments. These inhibitory synapses besides their distinct location are also structurally different compared to excitatory synapses (reviewed in Gatto and Broadie, 2010).


Biological compartments: Synaptogenesis is spatially and temporally strictly controlled process. It does not happen in a uniform way in all brain regions and there important differences between the times of appearance of the main two types of synapses (reviewed in Erecinska et al., 2004). For example, in rat hippocampus excitatory synapses are well established or fully mature within the two first postnatal weeks, whereas inhibitory synapses cannot be found prior to PND 18, after which it increases steadily to reach adult levels at PND 28. In addition, in rat neostriatal neurons the excitatory responses to both cortical and thalamic stimuli can be observed by PND 6, but the long-lasting hyperpolarization and late depolarization is never seen before PND 12.

Structural remodelling of synapses and formation of new synaptic contacts has been postulated as a possible mechanism underlying the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of plasticity which is involved in learning and memory. LTP induction results in a sequence of morphological changes consisting of a transient remodelling of the postsynaptic membrane followed by a marked increase in the proportion of axon terminals contacting two or more dendritic spines. Three-dimensional reconstruction revealed that these spines arose from the same dendrite. As pharmacological blockade of LTP prevented these morphological changes, it is suggested that LTP is associated with the formation of new, mature and probably functional synapses contacting the same presynaptic terminal and thereby duplicating activated synapses (Erik et al., 2006).

In human, synaptogenesis does not happen at the same time in all brain regions, as the prefrontal cortex lags behind in terms of synapse formation compared to the auditory and visual cortices. In contrast, synaptogenesis appears to proceed concurrently in different brain areas for rhesus monkey (Erecinska et al., 2004).


General role in biology: The period of rapid synaptogenesis or the so-called brain growth spurt is considered one of the most important processes that take place during brain development (Garner et al., 2002). This process is crucial not only in neurodevelopment but also plays a vital role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory and adaptation throughout life. Without this process no complex brain network can be established as synapse is the fundamental unit of connectivity and communication between neurons (Tau and Peterson, 2010). Cell adhesion represents the most direct way of coordinating synaptic connectivity in the brain. Recent evidence highlights the importance of a trans-synaptic interaction between postsynaptic neuroligins and presynaptic neurexins. These transmembrane molecules bind each other extracellularly to promote adhesion between dendrites and axons, facilitating synapse establishment (Dean and Dresbach, 2006). Furthermore, the number of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses created at single neuron dictates neuronal excitability and function (Schummers et al., 2002).

There is no OECD advised method for measuring synaptogenesis.

Anatomical methods can be used to structurally estimate the number of excitatory or inhibitory synapses. Immunostaining can be employed with specific antibodies that recognize vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) and the postsynaptic density protein-95 kDa (PSD-95) that are characteristic of excitatory synapses, while inhibitory synapses are identified by the presence of the vesicular GABA (VGAT) and vesicular inhibitory amino acid (VIAAT) transporters and the postsynaptic adaptor protein gephryin (Gatto and Broadie, 2010). There are commercial available synaptogenesis assay kits that rely on the immunostaining of cells with MAP-2, PSD-95 and synaptophysin. Some other presynaptic (Bassoon) and postsynaptic (ProSAP1/Shank2) markers have been suggested and showed to correlate well with the ultrastructural studies in cultured hippocampus primary cells (Grabrucker et al., 2009). Electron microscopy can also be applied to assess the prevalence of excitatory and inhibitory synapses amongst convergent contacts (Megias et al., 2001). Recently, a high content image analysis based on RNAi screening protocols has been suggested as a useful tool to create imaging algorithm for use in both in vitro and in vivo synaptic punctae analysis (Nieland et al., 2014).

	dcterms:description	"""Biological state: There are striking differences in neuronal network formation and function among the developing and mature brain. The developing brain shows a slow maturation and a transient passage from spontaneous, long-duration action potentials to synaptically-triggered, short-duration action potentials.

Furthermore, at this precise developmental stage the neuronal network is characterised by &quot;hyperexcitability&rdquo;, which is related to the increased number of local circuit recurrent excitatory synapses and the lack of &gamma;-amino-butyric acid A (GABAA)-mediated inhibitory function that appears much later. This &ldquo;hyperexcitability&rdquo; disappears with maturation when pairing of the pre- and postsynaptic partners occurs and synapses are formed generating population of postsynaptic potentials and population of spikes followed by developmental GABA switch. Glutamatergic neurotransmission is dominant at early stages of development and NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents are far more times longer than those in maturation, allowing more calcium to enter the neurons. The processes that are involved in increased calcium influx and the subsequent intracellular events seem to play a critical role in establishment of wiring of neural circuits and strengthening of synaptic connections during development (reviewed in Erecinska et al., 2004). Neurons that do not receive glutaminergic stimulation are undergoing developmental apoptosis.

During the neonatal period, the brain is subject to profound alterations in neuronal circuitry due to high levels of synaptogenesis and gliogenesis. For example, in neuroendocrine regions such as the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus (POA-AH), the site of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) system is developmentally regulated by glutamatergic neurons. The changes in the expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B system begin early in postnatal development, before the onset of puberty, thereby playing a role in establishing the appropriate environment for the subsequent maturation of GnRH neurons (Adams et al., 1999).

Biological compartments: Neural network formation and function happen in all brain regions but it appears to onset at different time points of development (reviewed in Erecinska et al., 2004). Glutamatergic neurotransmission in hippocampus is poorly developed at birth. Initially, NMDA receptors play important role but the vast majority of these premature glutamatergic synapses are &ldquo;silent&rdquo; possibly due to delayed development of hippocampal AMPA receptors. In contrast, in the cerebral cortex the maturation of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission happens much earlier. The &ldquo;silent&rdquo; synapses disappear by PND 7-8 in both brain regions mentioned above.

There is strong evidence suggesting that NMDA receptor subunit composition controls synaptogenesis and synapse stabilization (Gambrill and Barria, 2011). It is established fact that during early postnatal development in the rat hippocampus, synaptogenesis occurs in parallel with a developmental switch in the subunit composition of NMDA receptors from NR2B to NR2A. It is suggested that early expression of NR2A in organotypic hippocampal slices reduces the number of synapses and the volume and dynamics of spines. In contrast, overexpression of NR2B does not affect the normal number and growth of synapses. However, it does increase spine motility, adding and retracting spines at a higher rate. The C terminus of NR2B, and specifically its ability to bind CaMKII, is sufficient to allow proper synapse formation and maturation. Conversely, the C terminus of NR2A was sufficient to stop the development of synapse number and spine growth. These results indicate that the ratio of synaptic NR2B over NR2A controls spine motility and synaptogenesis, and suggest a structural role for the intracellular C terminus of NR2 in recruiting the signalling and scaffolding molecules necessary for proper synaptogenesis. Interestingly, it was found that genetic deletion of NR3A accelerates glutamatergic synaptic transmission, as measured by AMPAR-mediated postsynaptic currents recorded in hippocampal CA1. Consistent, the deletion of NR3A accelerates the expression of the glutamate receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, and GluR1 sugesting that glutamatergic synapse maturation is critically dependent upon activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (Henson et al., 2012).

General role in biology: The development of neuronal networks can be distinguished into two phases: an early &lsquo;establishment&rsquo; phase of neuronal connections, where activity-dependent and independent mechanisms could operate, and a later &lsquo;maintenance&rsquo; phase, which appears to be controlled by neuronal activity (Yuste and Sur, 1999). These neuronal networks facilitate information flow that is necessary to produce complex behaviors, including learning and memory (Mayford et al., 2012).

In vivo: The recording of brain activity by using electroencephalography (EEG), electrocorticography (ECoG) and local field potentials (LFP) assists towards the collection of signals generated by multiple neuronal cell networks. Advances in computer technology have allowed quantification of the EEG and expansion of quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis providing a sensitive tool for time-course studies of different compounds acting on neuronal networks&#39; function (Binienda et al., 2011). The number of excitatory or inhibitory synapses can be functionally studied at an electrophysiological level by examining the contribution of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic inputs. The number of them can be determined by variably clamping the membrane potential and recording excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs or IPSCs) (Liu, 2004).

In vitro: Microelectrode array (MEA) recordings are also used to measure electrical activity in cultured neurons (Keefer et al., 2001, Gramowski et al., 2000; Gopal, 2003; Johnstone et al., 2010). MEAs can be applied in high throughput platforms to facilitate screening of numerous chemical compounds (McConnell et al., 2012). Using selective agonists and antagonists of different classes of receptors their response can be evaluated in a quantitative manner (Novellino et al., 2011; Hogberg et al., 2011).

Patch clamping technique can also be used to measure neuronal network activity.In some cases, if required, planar patch clamping technique can also be used to measure neuronal networks activity (e.g., Bosca et al., 2014).

	dcterms:alternative	"Reduced, Presynaptic release of glutamate" ;
	dc:source	"AOPWiki" ;
	dcterms:description	"""Biological state: Glutamate is an amino acid with neurotransmitter function that is stored in presynaptic vesicles by the action of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) and under physiological conditions is found at a concentration of 100 mmol/L per vesicle. Different mechanisms are involved in the release of glutamate (reviewed in Meldrum, 2000). Glutamate is mainly released from the vesicles in a Ca2+-dependent mechanism that involves N- and P/Q-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, closely linked to vesicle docking sites. However, glutamate can also be released by reverse operation during reduction of Na+ and K+ gradient across the membrane like for example during cerebral ischemia. Interestingly, the synaptic release of glutamate is controlled by a wide range of presynaptic receptors that are not only glutamatergic like Group II and Group III of glutamate metabotropic receptors but also cholinergic such as nicotinic and muscarinic, adenosine (A1), kappa opioid, Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B, cholecystokinin and neuropeptide Y (Y2) receptors.
The synaptic effects of glutamate are rapidly terminated by action of glutamate transporters (excitatory amino acid transporters [EAATs]) located on the plasma membrane of astrocytes and neurons. Therefore, pre-synaptically released glutamate is mostly transported via EAATs to astrocytes and only a small portion is re-uptaken from the synaptic cleft into the presynaptic terminals(Rundfeldt et al., 1994; Blanke and VanDongen, 2009).
Following its release, glutamate exerts its effects via ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Although glutamate is available for binding to receptors for a short time, NMDA receptors show high affinity for this specific neurotransmitter that causes their activation compared to other receptors. 

Biological compartments: Glutamate is the most abundant amino acid in the diet, consequently is found at higher levels in plasma compared to cerebrospinal fluid. The blood brain barrier prevents the entry of glutamate, meaning that the glutamate present in CNS is derived from de novo synthesis of this neurotransmitter relying on the recycling of the main resources. Glutamine and Œ±-ketoglutarate are the major precursors of glutamate. Glutamine is converted via phosphate-activated glutaminase to glutamate and ammonia, whereas Œ±-ketoglutarate is transaminated into glutamate (Platt, 2007). In glial cells, the glutamate is metabolised via glutamine synthase into glutamine or metabolised into Œ±-ketoglutarate. These products are actively transported out of the glial cells and back into the pre-synaptic terminals for subsequent re-synthesis and storage of glutamate. 
Five transporters of glutamate have been identified in the CNS. Two are expressed predominantly in glia and three in neurons (reviewed in Meldrum, 2000).
The presence of glutamate has also been demonstrated in other tissues and organs as glutamate receptors have been found to be expressed in pancreatic Œ≤-cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts of bones (Nedergaard et al., 2002).
General role in biology: In mature nervous system, glutamate is known to play important role in synaptic plasticity. Similarly important is this neurotransmitter during development where it regulates neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis and apoptosis (reviewed in Mattson, 1996; Meldrum, 2000; Mattson, 2008).
The proper functioning of the central nervous system relays on the physiological homeostasis between glutamate and GABA, creating the opposite excitatory/inhibitory forces in the brain. Together, these two neurotransmitters constitute more than 90% of all neurotransmission. If this homeostasis is disturbed it could lead to anxiety disorders (Wieronska et al., 2015).

	dcterms:description	"""Mutations occurring in the offspring are the adverse effect. These mutations may have many eventual consequences including embryonic or fetal death, or genetic disease in the offspring. If mutations are viable, the specific sites and sequence changes of the mutations will govern the phenotypic outcome of the inherited mutation.
DETAILS: Evolutionarily advantageous or beneficial mutations are expected to be rare. Thus, the majority of inherited mutations will be neutral, with a somewhat smaller proportion expected to be harmful.  For example, Keightley (2012) used phylogenetic analysis to estimate that approximately 70 new mutations occur per generation, 2.2 of which, on average, are deleterious. These deleterious mutations affect the fitness of the organism (decreasing probability of reproducing) and thus impact the population. Alternatively, one must also consider pathogenic mutations, including those that do not affect fitness (e.g., diseases that may occur later in life and do not affect ability to reproduce). It is currently not possible to fully measure the consequences of pathogenic mutations, because we lack appropriate methods to measure their penetrance (e.g., mutations with low odds ratios, diverse phenotypes, or that contribute to multigenic disorders, etc.). Thus, we currently do not have precise mechanisms to evaluate the full impacts of de novo mutations. However, increasing use of whole genome sequencing is shedding light on the rate, spectrum, and consequences of de novo mutations. Evidence is accumulating on the major role of de novo mutations in rare Mendelian and genetically heterogeneous diseases (e.g., reviewed in Veltman and Brunner, 2012; Geschwind and Flint, 2015; Walsch et al. 2010). The rate and spectrum of human mutations is reviewed in Campbell and Eichler (2013), and potential consequences of mutations explored in Shendure and Akey (2015). Estimates indicate approximately 100 loss-of-function variants in a human genome, with as many as 20 exhibiting complete loss of gene function (McLaughlin et al. 2010). As an example, based on full genome sequencing data, paternal de novo sequence mutations are expected to account for an equal amount of the genetic burden of disease in ageing fathers as maternal aneuploidies due to ageing (Hurles, 2012). It is important to note that although mutations in coding regions are expected to have large effects on fitness, the absolute number of mutations in non-coding sequence that is under selection is actually greater than coding sequence (Green and Ewing, 2013). In general, it is widely accepted that de novo mutations contribute to the overall population genetic disease burden. The application of whole genome sequencing in the clinic is providing new knowledge on the unprecedented extent to which de novo mutations are contributing to a whole host of idiopathic human genetic disorders (e.g., Lupski et al., 2011; Ku et al., 2013; Gilissen et al., 2014).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""A heritable mutation is measured as a mutation occurring in the offspring that is not present in the parents and that is present in every cell type (the latter is not typically measured). Heritable mutations were previously measured using the Mouse Specific Locus Test (SLT) and variations on this assay (in rodents, fish and Drosophila). The Oak Ridge National Laboratory's SLT test, established by William and Lianne Russell, was the gold standard for heritable mutation screening for several decades. Transmission of mutations from exposed males to their offspring can also be measured by analysis of tandem repeat mutations, an accepted though not widely used method. No OECD guideline exists for either assay.

Mouse SLT or variations of this assay: The SLT and dominant cataract methods are no longer used today because they require too many rodents, but there is a fairly large database from the application of these methods. The SLT is based on the use of seven dominant visible trait markers in mice (Davis and Justice, 1998; Russell et al., 1979). Male mice are exposed to the mutagen and mated at varying times post-exposure to evaluate effects on different stages of spermatogenesis. Males are mated with females carrying recessive alleles at the seven loci screened in the assay. Functional mutations at the dominant (male) locus results in expression of the recessive phenotype in the offspring. These phenotypes include changes in coat colour, skeletal malformations, and other traits. Variations on this assay include looking at other visible traits including 34 common skeletal malformations and dominant cataracts. Additional variations include protein electrophoresis to explore protein changes (e.g., Lewis et al., 1991). 
Tandem repeat mutation: Tandem repeat mutations can be measured in offspring using a similar approach. Male mice are exposed to the mutagen and mated various times post-exposure to non-exposed females. DNA fingerprinting is used to measure changes in repeat length in offspring relative to their parents. This is currently the only assay that is able to measure the same mutational endpoint in sperm as in offspring, supporting that transmission of mutations from sperm to the offspring occurs. For methodologies please see Vilarino-Guell et al. (2003). A wide range of human genetic disorders are associated with de novo length change mutations in tandem repeat sequences (Mirkin, 2007).  However, it should also be noted that the mutations are induced through indirect mechanisms that are likely to be associated with polymerase errors during cell cycle arrest, rather than direct lesions at the locus (Yauk et al., 2002)
Next generation sequencing: With the advent and improvement in sequencing technologies, it is anticipated that heritable mutations will be measured by directly sequencing the offspring of males exposed to mutagenic agents. Current approaches require the exposure of parental gametes to a mutagenic agent, followed by mating and collection of offspring. Whole genome sequencing is applied to compare the genome sequences of parents and offspring to identify and haplotype (i.e., determine the parental origin) of de novo mutations (identified as mutations occurring in offspring but not their parents). Studies such as these have demonstrated that increasing paternal age causes an increase in both single nucleotide variants and tandem repeats in the offspring (Kong et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012). Proof of principle of the ability of application of genomics tools (array comparative genome hybridization and next generation sequencing) has been published for male mice exposed to radiation (Adewoye et al., 2015). The authors show that the frequency of de novo copy number variants (CNVs) and insertion/deletion events (indels) are significantly elevated in offspring of radiation-exposed fathers. Several papers have described how research in this field should proceed (Beal and Somers, 2011; Yauk et al., 2012; Yauk et al., 2015) and propose that this will be a paradigm-changing technology. 
Note: The Dominant Lethal test (OECD TG 478) is used to measure the effects of DNA damage in sperm on dominant lethality in the offspring. The overwhelming majority of dominant lethal mutations are due to chromosomal effects rather than gene mutations (Marchetti et al., 2005). Thus, this TG is not generally suited to the measurement of inherited gene mutations.

Finally, structure-activity relationships (SARs) have been developed to predict the possibility that a chemical will alkylate DNA (e.g., Vogel and Ashby, 1994; Benigni, 2005; Dai et al., 1989; Lewis and Griffith, 1987). 

Measurement of alkylation in male germ cells:
In rodent testes, studies have detected adducts in situ by immuhistocytological staining. For example, fixed testes are incubated with O6-EtGua -specific mouse monoclonal antibody and subsequently with a labeled anti-mouse IgG F antibody. Nuclear DNA is counterstained with DAPI 4,6-diamidino- 2-phenylindole. Fluorescence signals from immunostained O6-EtGua residues in DNA are visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitated using an image analysis system. Methods are described in (Seiler et al. 1997). An immunoslot blot assay for detection of O6-EtGua has been described previously in (Mientjes et al. 1996).
Alternatively, rodents have also been exposed to radio-labeled alkylating agents. Examples from the literature include [2-3H] ENU, [1-3H]di-ethyl sulfate, or [1-3H]ethyl-methane sulfonate. Following treatment with the labeled chemical, testis and other tissues of interest are removed. Germ cells are released from tubuli by pushing out the contents with forceps. Using this procedure all germ-cell stages are liberated from the tubuli, with the possible exception of part of the population of stem-cell spermatogonia that remain attached to the walls of the tubuli. DNA is then extracted from germ cells, empty testis tubuli and other tissues of interest. DNA adduct formation is determined after neutral and acid hydrolysis of DNA followed by separation of the various ethylation products using HPLC (described in van Zeeland et al. 1990).

Mutations in stem cells  (versus terminally differentiated non-replicating cells) are the most concerning, as these will persist in the organism. The consequence of the mutation, and thus the fate of the cell, depends on the location (e.g., coding versus non-coding) and the type (e.g., nonsense versus silent) of mutation.
Mutations can occur in somatic cells or germ cells (sperm or egg).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Mutations can be measured using a variety of both OECD and non-OECD mutagenicity tests. Some examples are given below.
Somatic cells:
The Salmonella mutagenicity test (Ames Test) is generally used as part of a first tier screen to determine if a chemical can cause gene mutations. This well-established test has an OECD test guideline (TG 471). A variety of bacterial strains are used, in the presence and absence of a metabolic activation system (e.g., rat liver microsomal S9 fraction), to determine the mutagenic potency of chemicals by dose-response analysis. A full description is found in Test No. 471: Bacterial Reverse Mutation Test (OECD).
A variety of in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation tests are described in OECD‚Äôs Test Guidelines 476 and 490. TG 476 is used to identify substances that induce gene mutations at the hprt (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase) gene, or the transgenic xprt (xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase) reporter locus. The most commonly used cells for the HPRT test include the CHO, CHL and V79 lines of Chinese hamster cells, L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells. The only cells suitable for the XPRT test are AS52 cells containing the bacterial xprt (or gpt) transgene (from which the hprt gene was deleted). 
The new OECD TG 490 describes two distinct in vitro mammalian gene mutation assays using the thymidine kinase (tk) locus and requiring two specific tk heterozygous cells lines: L5178Y tk+/-3.7.2C cells for the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA) and TK6 tk+/- cells for the TK6 assay. The autosomal and heterozygous nature of the thymidine kinase gene in the two cell lines enables the detection of cells deficient in the enzyme thymidine kinase following mutation from tk+/- to tk-/-.
It is important to consider that different mutation spectra are detected by the different mutation endpoints assessed. The non-autosomal location of the hprt gene (X-chromosome) means that the types of mutations detected in this assay are point mutations, including base pair substitutions and frameshift mutations resulting from small insertions and deletions. Whereas, the autosomal location of the transgenic xprt, tk, or gpt locus allows the detection of large deletions not readily detected at the hemizygous hprt locus on X-chromosomes. Genetic events detected using the tk locus include both gene mutations (point mutations, frameshift mutations, small deletions) and large deletions.
The transgenic rodent mutation assay (OECD TG 488) is the only assay capable of measuring gene mutation in virtually all tissues in vivo. Specific details on the rodent transgenic mutation reporter assays are reviewed in Lambert et al. (2005, 2009). The transgenic reporter genes are used for detection of gene mutations and/or chromosomal deletions and rearrangements resulting in DNA size changes (the latter specifically in the lacZ plasmid and Spi- test models) induced in vivo by test substances (OECD, 2009, OECD, 2011; Lambert et al., 2005). Briefly, transgenic rodents (mouse or rat) are exposed to the chemical agent sub-chronically. Following a manifestation period, genomic DNA is extracted from tissues, transgenes are rescued from genomic DNA, and transfected into bacteria where the mutant frequency is measured using specific selection systems.  
The Pig-a (phosphatidylinositol glycan, Class A) gene on the X chromosome codes for a catalytic subunit of the N-acetylglucosamine transferase complex that is involved in glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) cell surface anchor synthesis. Cells lacking GPI anchors, or GPI-anchored cell surface proteins are predominantly due to mutations in the Pig-a gene. Thus, flow cytometry of red blood cells expressing or not expressing the Pig-a gene has been developed for mutation analysis in blood cells from humans, rats, mice, and monkeys. The assay is described in detail in Dobrovolsky et al. (2010). Development of an OECD guideline for the Pig-a assay is underway. In addition, experiments determining precisely what proportion of cells expressing the Pig-a mutant phenotype have mutations in the Pig-a gene are in progress (e.g., Nicklas et al., 2015, Drobovolsky et al., 2015). A recent paper indicates that the majority of CD48 deficient cells from 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-treated rats (78%) are indeed due to mutation in Pig-a (Drobovolsky et al., 2015).

Germ cells:
Tandem repeat mutations can be measured in bone marrow, sperm, and other tissues using single-molecule PCR. This approach has been applied most frequently to measure repeat mutations occurring in sperm DNA. Isolation of sperm DNA is as described above for the transgenic rodent mutation assay, and analysis of tandem repeats is done using electrophoresis for size analysis of allele length using single-molecule PCR. For expanded simple tandem repeat this involved agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting, whereas for microsatellites sizing is done by capillary electrophoresis. Detailed methodologies for this approach are found in Yauk et al. (2002) and Beal et al. (2015).
Mutations in rodent sperm can also be measured using the transgenic reporter model (OECD TG 488). A description of the approach is found within this published TG. Further modifications to this protocol have now been made for the analysis of germ cells. Detailed methodology for detecting mutant frequency arising in spermatogonia is described in Douglas et al. (1995), O'Brien et al. (2013); and O'Brien et al. (2014). Briefly, male mice are exposed to the mutagen and killed at varying times post-exposure to evaluate effects on different phases of spermatogenesis. Sperm are collected from the vas deferens or caudal epididymis (the latter preferred). Modified protocols have been developed for extraction of DNA from sperm. 
A similar transgenic assay can be used in transgenic medaka (Norris and Winn, 2010).

Please note, gene mutations that occur in somatic cells in vivo (OECD Test. No. 488) or in vitro (OECD Test No. 476: In vitro Mammalian Cell Gene Mutation Test), or in bacterial cells (i.e., OECD Test No. 471) can be used as an indicator that mutations in male pre-meiotic germ cells may occur for a particular agent (sensitivity and specificity of other assays for male germ cell effects is given in Waters et al., 1994). However, given the very unique biological features of spermatogenesis relative to other cell types, known exceptions to this rule, and the small database on which this is based, inferring results from somatic cell or bacterial tests to male pre-meiotic germ cells must be done with caution. That mutational assays in somatic cells may predict mutations in germ cells has not been rigorously tested empirically (Singer and Yauk, 2010). The IWGT working group on germ cells specifically addressed this gap in knowledge in their report (Yauk et al., 2015) and recommended that additional research address this issue.
Mutations can be directly measured in humans (and other species) through the application of next-generation sequencing. Although single-molecule approaches are growing in prevalence, the most robust approach to measure mutation using next-generation sequencing today requires clonal expansion of the mutation to a sizable proportion (e.g., sequencing tumours; Shen et al., 2015), or analysis of families to identify germline derived mutations (reviewed in Campbell and Eichler, 2013; Adewoye et al., 2015).

	dcterms:description	"""DNA lesions may result from the formation of DNA adducts (i.e., covalent modification of DNA by chemicals), or by the action of agents such as radiation that may produce strand breaks or modified nucleotides within the DNA molecule. These DNA lesions are repaired through several mechanistically distinct pathways that can be categorized as follows. 
1) Damage reversal acts to reverse the damage without breaking any bonds within the sugar phosphate backbone of the DNA. The most prominent enzymes associated with damage reversal are photolyases (Sancar, 2003) that can repair UV dimers in some organisms, and O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) (Pegg 2011) and oxidative demethylases (Sundheim et al., 2008), which can repair some types of alkylated bases. 
2) Excision repair involves the removal of a damaged nucleotide(s) through cleavage of the sugar phosphate backbone followed by re-synthesis of DNA within the resultant gap. Excision repair of DNA lesions can be mechanistically divided into base excision repair (BER) (Dianov and H√ºbscher, 2013), in which the damaged base is removed by a damage-specific glycosylase prior to incision of the phosphodiester backbone at the resulting abasic site, and nucleotide excision repair (NER) (Sch√§rer, 2013), in which the DNA strand containing the damaged nucleotide is incised at sites several nucleotides 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô to the site of damage, and a polynucleotide containing the damaged nucleotide is removed prior to DNA resynthesis within the resultant gap. A third form of excision repair is mismatch repair (MMR), which does not act on DNA lesions but does recognize mispaired bases resulting from replication errors. In MMR the strand containing the misincorporated base is removed prior to DNA resynthesis. 
3) Double strand break repair (DSBR) is necessary to preserve genomic integrity when breaks occur in both strands of a DNA molecule. There are two major pathways for DSBR:  homologous recombination (HR), which operates primarily during S phase in dividing cells, and nonhomologous end joining  (NHEJ), which can function in both dividing and non-dividing cells (Teruaki Iyama and David M. Wilson III, 2013). 

Most DNA repair pathways are extremely efficient. However, in principal, all DNA repair pathways can be overwhelmed when the DNA lesion burden exceeds the capacity of a given DNA repair pathway to recognize and remove the lesion. Such DNA repair insufficiency may lead to toxicity or mutagenesis following DNA damage. Apart from extremely high DNA lesion burden, DNA insufficiency may arise through several different specific mechanisms. For example, during repair of DNA containing O6-alkylguanine adducts, AGT irreversibly binds a single O6-alkylguanine lesion and as a result is inactivated (this is termed suicide inactivation, as its own action causes it to become inactivated). Thus, the capacity of AGT to carry out alkylation repair can become rapidly saturated when the DNA repair rate exceeds the de novo synthesis of AGT (Pegg, 2011). A second mechanism relates to cell specific differences in the cellular levels or activity of some DNA repair proteins. For example, XPA is an essential component of the NER complex. The level of XPA that is active in NER is low in the testes, which may reduce the efficiency of NER in testes as compared to other tissues (K√∂berle et al., 1999). Likewise, both NER and BER have been reported to be deficient in cells lacking functional p53  (Adimoolam and Ford, 2003; Hanawalt et al., 2003; Seo and Jung, 2004). A third mechanism relates to the importance of the DNA sequence context of a lesion in its recognition by DNA repair enzymes. For example, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is repaired primarily by BER; the lesion is initially acted upon by a bifunctional glycosylase, OGG1, which carries out the initial damage recognition and excision steps of 8-oxoG repair. However, the rate of excision of 8-oxoG is modulated strongly by both chromatin components (Menoni et al., 2012) and DNA sequence context (Allgayer et al., 2013) leading to significant differences in the repair of lesions situated in different chromosomal locations. 
DNA repair is also remarkably error-free. However, misrepair can arise during repair under some circumstances. DSBR is notably error prone, particularly when breaks are processed through NHEJ, during which partial loss of genome information is common at the site of the double strand break (Iyama and Wilson, 2013). Excision repair pathways require the resynthesis of DNA and rare DNA polymerase errors during gap resynthesis will result in mutations (Brown et al., 2011). Errors may also arise during gap resynthesis when the strand that is being used as a template for DNA synthesis contains DNA lesions (Kozmin and Jinks-Robertson, 2013). In addition, it has been shown that sequences that contain tandemly repeated sequences, such as CAG triplet repeats, are subject to expansion during gap resynthesis that occurs during BER of 8-oxoG damage (Liu et al., 2009).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""There is no test guideline for this event. The event is usually inferred from measuring the retention of DNA adducts or the creation of mutations as a measure of lack of repair or incorrect repair. These ‚Äòindirect‚Äô measures of its occurrence are crucial to determining the mechanisms of genotoxic chemicals and for regulatory applications (i.e., determining the best approach for deriving a point of departure). More recently, a fluorescence-based multiplex flow-cytometric host cell reactivation assay (FM-HCR) has been developed to directly  measures the ability of human cells to repair plasmid reporters (Nagel et al., 2014).
INDIRECT MEASUREMENT
In somatic and spermatogenic cells, measurement of DNA repair is usually inferred by measuring DNA adduct formation/removal. Insufficient repair is inferred from the retention of adducts and from increasing adduct formation with dose. Insufficient DNA repair is also measured by the formation of increased numbers of mutations and alterations in mutation spectrum. The methods will be specific to the type of DNA adduct that is under study. 
Some EXAMPLES are given below for alkylated DNA.
DOSE-RESPONSE CURVE FOR ALKYL ADDUCTS/MUTATIONS: It is important to consider that some adducts are not mutagenic at all because they are very effectively repaired. Others are effectively repaired, but if these repair processes become overwhelmed mutations begin to occur. The relationship between exposure to mutagenic agents and the presence of adducts (determined as adducts per nucleotide) provide an indication of whether the removal of adducts occurs, and whether it is more efficient at low doses. A sub-linear DNA adduct curve suggests that less effective repair occurs at higher doses (i.e., repair processes are becoming saturated). A sub-linear shape for the dose-response curves for mutation induction is also suggestive of repair of adducts at low doses, followed by saturation of repair at higher doses. Measurement of a clear point of inflection in the dose-response curve for mutations suggests that repair does occur, at least to some extent, but reduced repair efficiency arises above the breakpoint.  A lack of increase in mutation frequencies (i.e., flat line for dose-response) for a compound showing a dose-dependent increase in adducts would imply that the adducts formed are either not mutagenic or are effectively repaired.
RETENTION OF ALKYL ADDUCTS: Alkylated DNA can be found in cells long after exposure has occurred. This indicates that repair has not effectively removed the adducts. For example, DNA adducts have been measured in hamster and rat spermatogonia several days following exposure to alkylating agents, indicating lack of repair  (Seiler et al., 1997; Scherer et al., 1987). 
MUTATION SPECTRUM: Shifts in mutation spectrum (i.e., the specific changes in the DNA sequence) following a chemical exposure (relative to non-exposed mutation spectrum) indicates that repair was not operating effectively to remove specific types of lesions. The shift in mutation spectrum is indicative of the types of DNA lesions (target nucleotides and DNA sequence context) that were not repaired. For example, if a greater proportion of mutations occur at guanine nucleotides in exposed cells, it can be assumed that the chemical causes DNA adducts on guanine that are not effectively repaired.

DIRECT MEASUREMENT
Nagel et al. (2014) we developed a fluorescence-based multiplex flow-cytometric host cell reactivation assay (FM-HCR) to measures the ability of human cells to repair plasmid reporters. These reporters contain different types and amounts of DNA damage and can be used to measure repair through by NER, MMR, BER, NHEJ, HR and MGMT.

Acetylcholinesterase features an anionic site (glutamate residue), and an esteratic site (serine hydroxyl group) [20,21]. In response to a stimulus, ACh is released into the synaptic cleft and binds to the receptor protein, resulting in changes to the flow of ions across the cell, thereby signaling nerve and muscle activity. The signal is stopped when the amine of ACh binds at the anionic site of AChE, and aligns the ester of ACh to the serine hydroxyl group of the enzyme. Acetylcholine is subsequently hydrolyzed, resulting in a covalent bond with the serine hydroxyl group and the subsequent release of choline, followed by a rapid hydrolysis of the enzyme to form free AChE and acetic acid [20,21]."

Direct measures of AChE activity levels can be made using the modified Ellman method, although selective inhibitors that remove other cholinesterases not directly related to cholinergic responses (e.g., butyrylcholinesterase) are required [45,46]. 

Radiometric methods have been identified as better for measuring inhibition because of carbamylation (carbamate exposure) [20,46,47].

A direct measure of cholinesterase activity levels can be made within the relevant tissues after in vivo exposure, specifically the brain as well as red blood cells in mammals.  Some analytical methods used to measure cholinesterase activity may not distinguish between butyrylcholinesterase, which is found with AChE in plasma and some skeletal and muscle tissues.  Although the structure of butyrylcholinesterase is very similar to AChE, its biological function is not clear, and its activity is not associated with cholinergic response covered under this AOP (Lushington et al., 2006).   Therefore experimental procedures used to measure cholinesterase as well as the tissue analyzed should be considered when evaluating studies reporting AChE inhibition (Wilson 2010; Wilson and Henderson 2007).  For measuring AChE levels, the Ellman method is recommended with some modifications (Ellman et al., 1961; Wilson et al., 1996) while radiometric methods have been identified as better for measuring inhibition due to carbamylation (carbamate exposure) (see Wilson 2010; Wilson et al., 1996; Johnson and Russell 1975).



In order to effectively bind to the AChE enzyme, thion forms of OPs (i.e., RO)3P=S) must first undergo a metabolic activation via mixed function oxidases to yield the active, oxon form (Fukuto 1990).  Estimating the potential toxicity in whole organisms based on in vitro data may be problematic since metabolic activation may be required (e.g.,  phosphorothionates) and may not be reflected in the in vitro test result (Guo et al. 2006; Lushington et al. 2006).

Typically, carbamates do not require metabolic activation in order to bind to the enzyme, although some procarbamates (e.g.,  carbosulfan) have been developed that are not direct inhibitors of AChE, but take advantage of metabolic distinctions between taxa, resulting in a toxic form in invertebrates (e.g.,  carbofuran) but not vertebrate species (Stenersen 2004).   Therefore in vitro assays measuring AChE inhibition for procarbamates in invertebrate species will not account for metabolic activation and therefore may not represent the actual enzyme activity.

""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""The interference of MeHg, acrylamide and acrolein&nbsp; with the normal catalytic function of thiol- or selenol-containing enzymes, transporters, channels, etc can be determined by different analytical methodologies. The activity of enzymes are typically determined by spectrophotometric, spectrofluorometric&nbsp; or radiometrical methodologies that quantify the rate of product appearance or the disappearance of&nbsp; substrate. The examples of HMM-SH or HMM-SeH enzymes that are altered by MeHg, acrylamide and acrolein presented in Table 3 (Table 3 and 4) are normally determined by spectrophotometric methodologies. Below we give a brief description on how to measure the enzymes listed in Table(s) 3 and 4.

Creatine Kinase (CK). CK activity can be measured using phosphocreatine and ADP as substrates. The formed creatine is estimated colorimetrically &nbsp;at 520 nm as described by Hughes (Hughes, 1962).

Glutathione (GSH): Total glutathione level was determined using the Glutathione Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, CS0260) according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions. Quantity of GSH was assessed by measuring the continuous reduction of 5,5&rsquo;-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) to 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) by spectrophotometry (Synergy MX) at 412 nm. Measures were taken at 1 min intervals for 5 minutes. The production rate of TNB is proportional to the concentration of glutathione up to 2 &micro;M and values for GSH concentration were calculated as the difference between TNB absorbance values measured at time 0 versus 5 min with reduced glutathione as standard.

Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is usually determined spectroscopically at 340 nm using a coupled assay with glutathione reductase (GR). Another methodologies can be found in Floh&eacute;, L., G&uuml;nzler, W.A. (1984). The reaction mixture usually contains (in mmol/L or mM) 50 phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 10-100 &micro;l sample, 0.24-1.0 U of glutathione reductase (usually from yeast), 1-4 &nbsp;GSH, 0.6-4.3&nbsp; EDTA and 0.15-0.34 &nbsp;NADPH . The reaction is started by adding 10-100 &micro;l peroxide (hydrogen peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide or tert-butylperoxide) to a final concentration of 0.1-2.0 mM . For quantification in crude extracts, the addition of azide is required to inhibit the catalase reaction, when H2O2 is used as substrate. The decrease in absorbance is followed at 340 nm from 1 to 10 min. The blank is made by substituting the sample by the same buffer in which the sample is prepared.

Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR). TrxR activity is normally measured by the method of Holmgren and Bjornstedt (1995).  The reaction mixture consisted of the following (in mM): 0.24 NADPH, 10 EDTA, 100 potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 5 5,5&rsquo;-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), and 0.2mg/mL of BSA.  The partially purified TrxR was added (to final concentration of 6&ndash;10 microg/ml of protein) to the cuvette containing the reaction mixture, and the absorbance is followed at 412 nm for 4 min. 

Type 2 5&rsquo;-deiodinase (DIO 2). Deiodinase is usually determined by measuring [125]I released from [125I]reverse T3 (rT3) in in a gamma counter after separation of [125]I by ion exchange chromatography (Dowex 50W-X2 resin) as described by Mori et al., 1996. The reaction medium contains (in mM): &nbsp;100 potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 EDTA, 20 dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 6-proryl-2-thiouracil (PTU), and 2 nM rT3.

Glutamine synthetase (GS). GS can be measured by different methods: a) the of formation of inorganic phosphate (Pi), b) ADP at 340 nm (using the enzymes pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase as coupled reactions), c) glutamine (e.g., determining the transformation of 14C-glutamate to 14C-glutamine) or d) the colorimetric formation of glutamylhydroxamate assay method. The glutamylhydroxamate assay method usually is determined in the presence of (in mM) 0.1 ml of enzyme solution (0.1 ml) plus 0.9 ml of the reaction solution with 50 imidazole-HCl buffer, 20 MgCI2, 25 mercaptoethanol, 50 sodium L-glutamate, 100 hydroxylamine, and 10 ATP. After incubation, 1.5 ml of FeCl3 (370 mM FeCl3, 670 mM HCl, and 200 mM trichloroacetic acid) is added. The mixture is centrifuged and the supernatant is used to determine the absorbance at 535 nm (Patel et al., 1982; Pishak and Phillips, 1979).

Ca2+-ATPase. Ca2+-ATPase can be determined directly by the quantification of inorganic phosphate released from ATP or indirectly by determining the 45Ca2+ uptake by brain microsomes (Freitas et al. 1996).&nbsp; The assay mixture for Ca2+ uptake determination has (in mM) 50 MOPS-Tris (pH 7.4), 5 MgCl2, , 1 ATP, 20 Pi (inorganic phosphate) and 0.04 CaCl2 (0.5 &micro;Ci/ml 45CaCl2). &nbsp;The microsome is then filtrated through Millipore filters (0.45 &micro;m) and flushed with La(NO3) 3 and the radioactivity in the filters is counted on a scintillation counter.

Complex I. Complex I activity was measured by the rate of NADH-dependent ferricyanide reduction as described in (Cassina and Radi,1996). In short, the NADH dehydrogenase can be determined in by the reduction of ferricyanide &nbsp;at 420 nm in the presence of (in mM) 0.2 NADH and 0.5 ferrycianide. The activity is determine in the presence of 5 &micro;M rotenone.

Complex II and Complex II-III. The complex II activity or succinate -2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIPI) reductase activity&nbsp; and the complex III (succinate: cytochrome c oxidoreductase or complex II-CoQ-complex III activity) can be determined by the method of Fischer in the presence of (in mM): 50 potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 20 succinate, 2 KCN and 0.05 DCIPI at 600 nm or 0.05 of oxidized cytochrome c at&nbsp; 550 nm.

Complex IV. Cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) activity can be determined spectrophotometrically by the method of Rustin et al. 1994 at 550 nm.

	dcterms:description	"""Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses. High levels of oxidizing free radicals can be very damaging to cells and molecules within the cell.&nbsp; As a result, the cell has important defense mechanisms to protect itself from ROS. For example, Nrf2 is a transcription factor and master regulator of the oxidative stress response. During periods of oxidative stress, Nrf2-dependent changes in gene expression are important in regaining cellular homeostasis (Nguyen, et al. 2009) and can be used as indicators of the presence of oxidative stress in the cell.

In addition to the directly damaging actions of ROS, cellular oxidative stress also changes cellular activities on a molecular level. Redox sensitive proteins have altered physiology in the presence and absence of ROS, which is caused by the oxidation of sulfhydryls to disulfides (2SH &agrave;SS) on neighboring amino acids (Antelmann and Helmann 2011). Importantly Keap1, the negative regulator of Nrf2, is regulated in this manner (Itoh, et al. 2010).

	dc:title	"Glutamate dyshomeostasis" ;
	dcterms:alternative	"Glutamate dyshomeostasis" ;
	dc:source	"AOPWiki" ;
	dcterms:description	"""Glutamate (Glu) is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), where it plays major roles in multiple aspects, such as development, learning, memory and response to injury (Featherstone, 2010). However, it is well recognized that Glu at high concentrations at the synaptic cleft acts as a toxin, inducing neuronal injury and death (Meldrum, 2000; Ozawa et al., 1998) secondary to activation of glumatergic N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and Ca2+ influx. Glu dyshomeostasis is a consequence of perturbation of&nbsp; astrocyte/neuron interactions and the transport of this amino acid, as will be discussed below.

Astrocytes are critically involved in neuronal function and survival, as they produce neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), as well as express two main glutamate transporters responsible for the removal of excessive Glu from the synaptic clefts (Chai et al., 2013; Sheldon et al., 2007). Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, playing a major role in memory and cognitive function (Platt, 1997), and Glu transporters as such prevent the overstimulation of post-synaptic glutamate receptors that lead to excitotoxic neuronal injury (Sattler et al., 2001; Dobble, 1999). Among the five subtypes of Glu transporters identified, glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) and Glu transporter-1 (GLT-1) [excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) 1 and 2 in humans, respectively], are predominantly expressed in astrocytes. They are responsible for the uptake of excess glutamate from the extracellular space (Furuta et al., 1997; Lehre et al., 1995; Tanaka, 2000), supported by the fact that knockdown of either GLT-1 or GLAST in mice increases extracellular glutamate levels, leading to excitotoxicity related neurodegeneration and progressive paralysis (Bristol and Rothstein, 1996). In the adult brain, EAAT2 accounts for &gt;90% of extracellular glutamate clearance (Danbolt, 2001; Kim et al., 2011; Rothstein et al., 1995), and genetic deletion of both alleles of GLT-1 in mice leads to the development of lethal seizures (Rothstein et al., 1996). On the other hand, EAAT1-3 play a major role during human brain development, in particular in corticogenesis, where they are expressed in proliferative zones and in radial glia, and alterations of Glu transporters contributes to disorganized cortex seen in migration disorders (Furuta et al., 2005;Regan et al., 2007). Indeed, disruption of&nbsp;glutamate&nbsp;signaling is thought to be part of the etiology underlying some neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia (Chiocchetti et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2012). Genetic variants associated with autism spectrum disorders were enriched in glutamatergic pathways, affecting receptor signalling, metabolism and transport (Chiocchetti et al, 2014).

Extracellular Glu released by neurons is taken up by astrocytes, which is converted into glutamine (Gln) by glutamine synthetase (GS), a thiol-containing enzyme (cf MIE, Binding to SH-/seleno containing proteins). Intercellular compartmentation of Gln and Glu, the so-called Gln/Glu-GABA cycle (GGC), is critical for optimal CNS function.13C NMR studies have demonstrated that the ratio of Gln/Glu is extremely high and increases with brain activity (Shen et al., 1999). Thus the GGC gives rise to the amino acid neurotransmitters Glu and GABA via dynamic astrocyte neuron interactions. Glu released at synaptic terminals is taken up by surrounding astrocytes via GLT-1 and GLAST (Rothstein et al., 1994; 1996). A small proportion of the astrocytic formed Gln via a reaction mediated by GS is transported into the extracellular space by Gln carriers, with a predominant role for System N/A transporter (SNAT3), which belongs to the bidirectional transporter System N (Chaudhry et al., 2002).

In addition to System N, release of Gln from astrocytes is mediated by other transport systems, including Systems L (LAT2) and ASC (ASCT2). Extracellular Gln is taken up into GABAergic and Glu-ergic neurons by the unidirectional System A transporters SNAT1 (Melone et al., 2004) and SNAT2 (Grewal et al., 2009). Once in neurons, Gln is converted to Glu by the mitochondrial enzyme phosphate-activated glutaminase (Kvamme et al., 2001). Additionally, Glu is packaged into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular VGLUT transporter (Bellocchio et al., 1998), released into the extracellular space and taken up by astrocytes where it is converted back to Gln by GS, thus completing the GGC (Fig. 1).

	Glutamate Assay Kit from Abcam (ab83389) provides a sensitive detection method of the glutamate in a variety of samples. This kit will only measure free glutamate levels but not glutamic acid found in the backbone of peptides or proteins.

Activation refers to a phenotypic modification of the resident cells that includes alterations in their secretions, activation of biosynthetic pathways, production of pro-inflammatory proteins and lipids, and morphological changes. While these represent a pleiotropic range of responses that can vary with the tissue, there are a number of common markers or signs of activation that are measurable.

Examples of Common markers are


	NF-kB
	AP-1
	Jnk
	P38/mapk


These described commonalities allow the use of this KE as a hub KE in the AOP network. However, despite the similarities in the inflammatory process, the type of reactive cells and the molecules triggering their reactivity may be tissue-specific. Therefore, for practical reasons, a tissue specific description of the reactive cells and of the triggering factors is necessary in order to specify in a tissue-specific manner, which cell should be considered and what should be measured.

BRAIN 

The most easily detectable feature of brain inflammation or neuroinflammation is activation of microglial cells and astrocytes. It is evidenced by changes in shape, increased expression of certain antigens, and accumulation and proliferation of the glial cells in affected regions (Aschner, 1998; Graeber &amp; Streit, 1990; Monnet-Tschudi et al, 2007; Streit et al, 1999; Kraft and Harry, 2011; Claycomb et al., 2013). Upon stimulation by cytokines, chemokines or inflammogens (e.g. from pathogens or from damaged neurons), both glial cell types activate inflammatory signaling pathways, which result in increased expression and/or release of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, eicosanoids, and metalloproteinases (Dong &amp; Benveniste, 2001) (cf KE: pro-inflammatory mediators, increased), as well as in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) (Brown &amp; Bal-Price, 2003). Different types of activation states are possible for microglia and astrocytes, resulting in pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory signaling, and other cellular functions (such as phagocytosis) (Streit et al., 1999; Nakajima and Kohsaka, 2004). Therefore, neuroinflammation can have both neuroprotective/neuroreparative and neurodegenerative consequences (Carson et al., 2006; Monnet-Tschudi et al, 2007; Aguzzi et al., 2013&nbsp;; Glass et al., 2010). Under normal physiological conditions, microglial cells survey the nervous system for neuronal integrity (Nimmerjahn et al, 2005) and for invading pathogens (Aloisi, 2001; Kreutzberg, 1995; Kreutzberg, 1996; Rivest, 2009). They are the first type of cell activated (first line of defense), and can subsequently induce astrocyte activation (Falsig, 2008). Two distinct states of microglial activation have been described (Gordon, 2003; Kigerl et al, 2009; Maresz et al, 2008; Mosser &amp; Edwards, 2008; Perego et al; Ponomarev et al, 2005): The M1 state is classically triggered by interferon-gamma and/or other pro-inflammatory cytokines, and this state is characterized by increased expression of integrin alpha M (Itgam) and CD86, as well as the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6), and it is mostly associated with neurodegeneration. The M2 state is triggered by IL-4 and IL-13 (Maresz et al, 2008; Perego et al, 2011; Ponomarev et al, 2007) and induces the expression of mannose receptor 1 (MRC1), arginase1 (Arg 1) and Ym1/2; it is involved in repair processes. The activation of astrocytes by microglia-derived cytokines or TLR agonists resembles the microglial M1 state (Falsig 2006). Although classification of the M1/M2 polarization of microglial cells may be considered as a simplification of authentic microglial reaction states (Ransohoff, 2016), a similar polarization of reactive astrocytes has been described recently Liddlelow et al., 2017): Interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1a), TNF and subcomponent q (C1q) released by activated microglial cells induce A1-reactive astrocytes, which lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis and induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes.

BRAIN&nbsp;

Neuroinflammation, i.e. the activation of glial cells can be measured by quantification of cellular markers (most commonly), or of released mediators (less common). As multiple activation states exist for the two main cell types involved, it is necessary to measure several markers of neuroinflammation:


	Microglial activation can be detected based on the increased numbers of labeled microglia per volume element of brain tissue (due to increase of binding sites, proliferation, and immigration of cells) or on morphological changes. A specific microglial marker, used across different species, is CD11b. Alternatively various specific carbohydrate structures can be stained by lectins (e.g. IB4). Beyond that, various well-established antibodies are available to detect microglia in mouse tissue (F4/80), phagocytic microglia in rat tissue (ED1) or more generally microglia across species (Iba1). Transgenic mice are available with fluorescent proteins under the control of the CD11b promoter to easily quantify microglia without the need for specific stains.
	The most frequently used astrocyte marker is glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP (99% of all studies) (Eng et al., 2000). This protein is highly specific for astrocytes in the brain, and antibodies are available for immunocytochemical detection. In neuroinflamatory brain regions, the stain becomes more prominent, due to an upregulation of the protein, a shape change/proliferation of the cells, and/or better accessibility of the antibody. Various histological quantification approaches can be used. Occasionally, alternative astrocytic markers, such as vimentin of the S100beta protein, have been used for astrocyte staining (Struzynska et al., 2007). Antibodies for complement component 3 (C3), the most characteristic and highly upregulated marker of A1 neurotoxic reactive astrocytes are commercially available.
	All immunocytochemical methods can also be applied to cell culture models.
	In patients, microglial accumulation can be monitored by PET imaging, using [11C]-PK 11195 as a microglial marker (Banati et al., 2002).
	Activation of glial cells can be assessed in tissue or cell culture models also by quantification of sets of M1/M2 phenotype markers. This can for instance be done by PCR quantification, immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting.

	dcterms:description	"""Inflammatory mediators are soluble, diffusible molecules that act locally at the site of tissue damage and infection, and at more distant sites. They can be divided into exogenous and endogenous mediators.

Exogenous mediators of inflammation are bacterial products or toxins like endotoxin or LPS. Endogenous mediators of inflammation are produced from within the (innate and adaptive) immune system itself, as well as other systems. They can be derived from molecules that are normally present in the plasma in an inactive form, such as peptide fragments of some components of complement, coagulation, and kinin systems. Or they can be released at the site of injury by a number of cell types that either contain them as preformed molecules within storage granules, e.g. histamine, or which can rapidly switch on the machinery required to synthesize the mediators.

The increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators can have negative consequences on the parenchymal cells leading even to cell death, as described for TNF-a or peroxynitrite on neurons (Chao et al., 1995; Brown and Bal-Price, 2003). In addition, via a feedback loop, they can act on the reactive resident cells thus maintaining or exacerbating their reactive state; and by modifying elements of their signalling pathways, they can favour the M1 phenotypic polarization and the chronicity of the inflammatory process (Taetzsch et al., 2015).

Basically, this event occurs equally in various tissues and does not require tissue-specific descriptions. Nevertheless, there are some specificities such as the release of glutamate by brain reactive glial cells (Brown and Bal-Price, 2003; Vesce et al., 2007).The differences may rather reside in the type of insult favouring the increased expression and/or release of a specific class of inflammatory mediators, as well the time after the insult reflecting different stages of the inflammatory process. For these reasons, the analyses of the changes of a battery of inflammatory mediators rather than of a single one is a more adequate measurement of this KE.

The Peroxisome Proliferator Activated receptor Œ± (PPARŒ±) belongs to the  Peroxisome Proliferator Activated receptors (PPARs; NR1C) steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor superfamily of transcription factors.
Biological compartments
PPARŒ± is expressed in high levels in tissues that perform significant catabolism of fatty acids (FAs), such as brown adipose tissue, liver, heart, kidney, and intestine (Michalik et al. 2006). The receptor is present also in skeletal muscle, intestine, pancreas, lung, placenta and testes (Mukherjee et al. 1997), (Schultz et al. 1999). 
General role in biology
PPARs are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives; they are sensors of dietary lipids and are involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, immune response and peroxisome proliferation (Wahli and Desvergne 1999), (Evans, Barish, &amp; Wang, 2004). PAPRŒ± is a also a target of hypothalamic hormone signalling and was found to play a role in embryonic development (Yessoufou and Wahli 2010).
Fibrates, activators of PPARŒ±, are commonly used to treat hypertriglyceridemia and other dyslipidemic states as they have been shown to decrease circulating lipid levels (Lefebvre et al. 2006).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Binding of ligands to PPARŒ± is measured using binding assays in vitro and in silico, whereas the information about functional activation is derived from transactivation assays (e.g. transactivation assay with reporter gene) that demonstrate functional activation of a nuclear receptor by a specific compound. Binding of agonists within the ligand-binding site of PPARs causes a conformational change  of nuclear receptor that promotes binding to transcriptional co-activators. Conversely, binding of antagonists results in a conformation that favours the binding of co-repressors (Yu and Reddy 2007), (Viswakarma et al. 2010).
Transactivation assays are performed using transient or stably transfected cells with the PPARŒ± expression plasmid and a reporter plasmid, respectively. There are also other methods that have been used to measure PPARŒ± activity, such as the Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) or commercially available PPARŒ± transcription factor assay kits, see Table 1. 
The transactivation (stable transfection) assay provides the most applicable OECD Level 2 assay (i.e. In vitro assays providing mechanistic data) aimed at identifying the initiating event leading to an adverse outcome (LeBlanc, Norris, and Kloas 2011). Currently no internationally validated assays for regulatory purposes are available.

Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) functions as a cholesterol transfer protein and acts directly on lipids of the outer mitochondrial membrane to promote cholesterol translocation (Stocco 2001). Reduction of the protein impacts on the amount of substrate available for steroidogenesis. 

Biological compartments
StAR is expressed principally in steroidogenic tissues (Bauer et al. 2000).
General role in biology
StAR is required for cholesterol shuttling across the mitochondrial membrane and appears to regulate acute steroid production (Clark and Stocco, 1997). Transcriptional or translational inhibition of StAR expression results in a dramatic decrease in steroid biosynthesis, whereas ~10‚Äì15% of steroid synthesis appears to be mediated through StAR-independent mechanisms (Manna et al. 2001) (Clark and Stocco, 1997).

	dcterms:description	"""Biological state
Steroidogenesis begins with the transport of cholesterol from intracellular stores into mitochondria. This process involves a series of protein-protein interactions involving cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins located at both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. In steroidogenic cells the cholesterol import to the mitochondrial inner membrane is crucial for steroid synthesis (Rone, Fan, and Papadopoulos 2009). This process is facilitated by the Scavenger Receptor Class B, type 1 (SR-B1) [more relevant for rodents, than for humans] that mediates the selective uptake of cholesterol esters from high-density lipoproteins. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) and the translator protein (TSPO) [former peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)]  mediate cholesterol transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone is done by Cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), the start of steroidogenesis [reviewed in (Miller and Auchus 2011)].

Biological compartments
In mitochondria of steroidogenic tissues there are two specialized mechanisms related to hormone synthesis: one by which cholesterol is delivered to the mitochondria and the other by which specialized intra-mitochondrial enzymes participate in the synthesis of hormonal steroids. 

General role in biology
Systemic steroid hormones are primarily formed by the gonads, adrenal glands, and during in utero development by the placenta. Some other organs like brain (Baulieu 1998), and heart (Kayes-Wandover and White 2000) have also been identified as steroid-producing tissues, mainly for local needs. The steroid hormones are indispensable for mammalian life. They are made from cholesterol via complex biosynthetic pathways that are initiated by specialized, tissue-specific enzymes in mitochondria. These hormones include glucocorticoids (cortisol, corticosterone) and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) produced in the adrenal cortex, estrogens (estradiol), progestins (progesterone) and androgens (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone) produced in the gonads, and calciferols (1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [1,25OH2D]) produced in the kidneys (Miller and Auchus 2011). Cholesterol is the precursor for the synthesis of steroid hormones in mitochondria. Steroidogenesis begins with the metabolism of cholesterol to pregnenolone facilitated by P450scc. The rate of steroid formation depends on the rate of cholesterol transport from intracellular stores to the inner mitochondrial membrane and the loading of P450scc with cholesterol (Miller and Auchus 2011). 
Interference with one or more of these reactions leads to reduced steroid production.
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""This KE can be indirectly measured by:
1.	Expression of the proteins involved in cholesterol transport by qPCR or Western blot.
3.	Cholesterol transport to the mitochondrial inner membrane in intact cells:


Indirectly as pregnenolone formation by cells. The pregnenolone concentration is assayed by commercially available radioimmunoassays and reflects the amount of cholesterol transported to the mitochondrial inner membrane (Charman et al. 2010).

Filipin staining is one of the most widely used tools for studying intracellular cholesterol distribution. The fluorescent detergent filipin binds selectively to cholesterol (and not to cholesterol esters) (Schroeder, Holland, and Bieber 1971). Filipin can be only used for the qualitative analysis of cholesterol distribution, since its fluorescence intensity is not necessarily linearly related to cholesterol content.

Testosterone is a steroid hormone from the androgen group and is found in humans and other vertebrates. 
Biological compartments
In humans and other mammals, testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and, to a lesser extent, the ovaries of females and other steroidogenic tissues (e.g., brain, adipose). It either acts locally /or is transported to other tissues via blood circulation. Testosterone synthesis takes place within the mitochondria of Leydig cells, the testosterone-producing cells of the testis. It is produced upon stimulation of these cells by Luteinizing hormone (LH) that is secreted in pulses into the peripheral circulation by the pituitary gland in response to Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Testosterone and its aromatized product, estradiol, feed back to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to suppress transiently LH and thus testosterone production. In response to reduced testosterone levels, GnRH and LH are produced. This negative feedback cycle results in pulsatile secretion of LH followed by pulsatile production of testosterone (Ellis, Desjardins, and Fraser 1983), (Chandrashekar and Bartke 1998).
General role in biology
Testosterone is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid. Male sexual differentiation depends on testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and the expression of androgen receptors by target cells (Manson and Carr 2003). During the development secretion of androgens by Leydig cells is essential for masculinization of the foetus (Nef 2000). 
The foetal Leydig cells develop in utero. These cells become competent to produce testosterone in rat  by gestational day (GD) 15.5, with increasing production thereafter. Peak steroidogenic activity is reached just prior to birth, on GD19 (Chen, Ge, and Zirkin 2009). Testosterone secreted by foetal Leydig cells is required for the differentiation of the male urogenital system late in gestation (Huhtaniemi and Pelliniemi 1992). Foetal Leydig cells also play a role in the scrotal descent of the testis through their synthesis of insulin-like growth factor 3 (Insl3), for review see (Nef 2000).
In humans, the first morphological sign of testicular differentiation is the formation of testicular cords, which can be seen between 6 and 7 weeks of gestation. Steroid-secreting Leydig cells can be seen in the testis at 8 weeks of gestation. At this period, the concentration of androgens in the testicular tissue and blood starts to rise, peaking at 14-16 weeks of gestation. This increase comes with an increase in the number of Leydig cells for review see (Rouiller-Fabre et al. 2009).
Adult Leydig cells, which are distinct from the foetal Leydig cells, form during puberty and supply the testosterone required for the onset of spermatogenesis, among other functions. Distinct stages of adult Leydig cell development have been identified and characterized. The stem Leydig cells are undifferentiated cells that are capable of indefinite self-renewal but also of differentiation to steroidogenic cells. These cells give rise to progenitor Leydig cells,  which proliferate, continue to differentiate, and give rise to the immature Leydig cells. Immature Leydig cells synthesize high levels of testosterone metabolites and develop into  terminally differentiated adult Leydig cells, which  produce high levels of testosterone. With aging, both serum and testicular testosterone concentrations progressively decline, for review see (Nef 2000).
Androgens play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of male reproductive and sexual functions.
Low levels of circulating androgens can cause disturbances in male sexual development, resulting in congenital
abnormalities of the male reproductive tract. Later in life, this may cause reduced fertility, sexual dysfunction,
decreased muscle formation and bone mineralisation, disturbances of fat metabolism, and cognitive
dysfunction. Testosterone levels decrease as a process of ageing: signs and symptoms caused by this decline
can be considered a normal part of ageing.

Testosterone (T) is a steroid hormone from the androgen group. T serves as a substrate for two metabolic pathways that produce antagonistic sex steroids.

Testosterone is synthesized by the gonads and other steroidogenic tissues (e.g., brain, adipose), acts locally and/or is transported to other tissues via blood circulation. Leydig cells are the testosterone-producing cells of the testis.

General role in biology

Androgens, the main male sex steroids, are the critical factors responsible for the development of the male phenotype during embryogenesis and for the achievement of sexual maturation at puberty. In adulthood, androgens remain essential for the maintenance of male reproductive function and behaviour. Apart from their effects on reproduction, androgens affect a wide variety of non-reproductive tissues such as skin, bone, muscle, and brain (Heemers, Verhoeven, &amp; Swinnen, 2006). Androgens, principally T and 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), exert most of their effects by interacting with a specific receptor, the androgen receptor (AR), for review see (Murashima, Kishigami, Thomson, &amp; Yamada, 2015). On the one hand, testosterone can be reduced by 5&alpha;-reductase to produce 5&alpha; dihydrotestosterone (DHT). On the other hand, testosterone can be aromatized to generate estrogens. Testosterone effects can also be classified by the age of usual occurrence, postnatal effects in both males and females are mostly dependent on the levels and duration of circulating free testosterone.

The presence of TSOP has been confirmed in Leydig and Sertoli cells (Morohaku, Phuong, and Selvaraj 2013), granulosa cells (Amsterdam and Suh 1991) and to a lesser extent in thecal cells (Morohaku, Phuong, and Selvaraj 2013). In subcellular fractions, binding sites for the TSOP have been identified to be present in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) (R. R. Anholt et al. 1985), (R. Anholt et al. 1986). Transcriptional regulation of TSPO genes has been examined and recently reviewed (Morohaku, Phuong, and Selvaraj 2013).

General role in biology: regulation of lipid transport

TSPO mediates the delivery of the substrate cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial side chain cleavage enzyme P450scc (Besman et al. 1989). TSPO ligands stimulate steroidogenesis and induce cholesterol movement from the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) (Besman et al. 1989).

	mmo:0000000	"""TSPO levels can be assayed by standard methods for assessment of gene expression levels like qPCR or direct protein levels by Western blot.

The level of TSPO as well as other steroidogenic protein can be measured in vitro cultured Leydig cells. The methods for culturing Leydig cells can be found in the Database Service on Alternative Methods to animal experimentation (DB-ALM): Leydig Cell-enriched Cultures [1], Testicular Organ and Tissue Culture Systems [2].

Uncertainties and Inconsistencies

This information needs to be moved to a key event relationship page.

TSPO -knockout mice have shown embryonic lethality (Lacap&egrave;re and Papadopoulos 2003); in contrast recent findings have shown no effect on viability of foetuses (Tu et al. 2014). Aberrant TSPO levels have been linked to multiple diseases, including cancer, endocrine disorders, brain injury, neurodegeneration, ischemia-reperfusion injury and inflammatory diseases (Wang, Fan, and Papadopoulos 2012). However, recent studies have shown opposite results. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor/translocator protein global knock-out mice are viable and show no effects on steroid hormone biosynthesis (Tu et al. 2014), (Morohaku et al. 2014). As stated in a recent review &quot;At this point in time, a functional designation for TSPO is still actively being sought&quot; (Selvaraj, Stocco, and Tu 2015).

	dcterms:description	"""Biological state

Male reproductive tract malformations (congenital malformation of male genitalia) comprise any physical abnormality of the male internal or external genitalia present at birth. Some result from excessive or deficient androgen effect, others result from teratogenic effects, or are associated with anomalies of other parts of the body in a recognizable pattern (i.e., a syndrome). The cause of many of these birth defects is unknown.

Hypospadias is a defect of the urogenital system, a malformation in which the urethra opens on the underside of the penis instead of the tip. It results from an incomplete closure of the urethral folds, leaving a split on the penis (Kalfa, Philibert, and Sultan 2009). When the urethra opens to the glans or corona of the penis, it is called distal, whereas opening to the shaft or penoscrotal area defines hypospadias as proximal. Androgens regulate the masculinization of external genitalia. Therefore any defects in androgen biosynthesis, metabolism or action during foetal development can cause hypospadias. Gene defects causing disorders of testicular differentiation, conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone or mutations in the androgen receptor can also result in hypospadias (Kalfa et al. 2008). In about 20% of patients with isolated hypospadias there are signs of endocrine abnormalities by the time of diagnosis (Rey et al. 2005). The majority of hypospadias are believed to have a multifactorial etiology, although a small percentage do result from single gene mutations (Baskin, Himes, and Colborn 2001). The only treatment of hypospadias is surgery, thus, prevention is imperative.


Biological compartments: reproductive system

	mmo:0000000	"""Malformations are detected by macroscopically for any structural abnormality or pathological change. The Congenital malformation of the genitalia is a medical term referring to a broad category of conditions that for humans is classified by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in chapter &quot;Congenital malformations of genital organs&quot; (Q50-Q56) e.g.Q54 Hypospadias, Q53 Undescended testicle. Hypospadias is usually diagnosed during the routine examination after birth. The hypospadias belongs to the category of &quot;Congenital malformation of the genitalia&quot; - a medical term referring to a broad category of conditions as classified in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in chapter &quot;Congenital malformations of genital organs&quot; (Q50-Q56) e.g. Q54 Hypospadias.

The anogenital distance (AGD) is a sexual dimorphism that results from the sex difference in foetal androgen (DHT) levels (Rhees et al., 1997). The AGD, the distance from the anus to the genitals, is widely used as biomarker of prenatal androgen exposure during a reproductive programming window (Wolf et al. 1999), (McIntyre, Barlow, and Foster 2001), (Macleod et al. 2010). The AGD is a marker of perineal growth and caudal migration of the genital tubercle. It is androgen-dependent in male rodents (Bowman et al. 2003). Measurement of AGD has also been proposed as a quantitative biomarker of foetal endocrine disruptor exposure in humans (Arbuckle et al. 2008), (Dean and Sharpe 2013). A longer (more &ldquo;masculine&rdquo;) AGD is typically associated with favourable health outcomes, while a shorter AGD is associated with adverse health outcomes. The AGD in males is approximately double that of females. Less is known about clinical correlates of AGD in females, although one study found that in women a longer AGD was associated with increased odds of multifollicular ovaries (Mendiola et al. 2012). The AGD is reflecting the prenatal hormonal milieu and in addition a biomarker for the risk of reproductive health problems linked to that early hormonal environment (Barrett et al. 2014). In animal studies, AGD measured from the genital tubercle to the anus is a sensitive marker of in utero exposure to androgens and anti-androgens, and is used extensively in animal reproductive toxicology studies (McIntyre, Barlow, and Foster 2001). AGD of each pup should be measured on at least one occasion from pre natal day postnatal day (PND) 0 through PND 4. Pup body weight should be collected on the day the AGD is measured and the AGD should be normalized to a measure of pup size, preferably the cube root of body weight (12). AGD is influenced by the body weight of the animal and therefore, this should be taken into account when evaluating the data (Gallavan et al, 1999). Body weight as a covariable may also be used (Howdeshell et al. 2007). Decreased AGD in male rats is a hallmark of exposure to antiandrogenic substances (Noriega et al, 2009; Christiansen et al, 2010). A statistically significant change in AGD that cannot be explained by the size of the animal indicates an adverse effect of exposure and should be considered in setting the NOAEL (OECD, 2008).


The extended one-generation in vivo reproductive toxicity study OECD TG 443 [1]is used to investigate adverse effects of chemical substances on fertility and developmental toxicity in the rat, in which AGD is measured.

	dcterms:description	"""The AHR Receptor

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix Per-ARNT-Sim (bHLH-PAS) superfamily and consists of three domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD), ligand binding domain (LBD) and transactivation domain (TAD)[1]. Other members of this superfamily include the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT), which acts as a dimerization partner of the AHR [2][3]; Per, a circadian transcription factor; and Sim, the &ldquo;single-minded&rdquo; protein involved in neuronal development [4][5]. This group of proteins shares a highly conserved PAS domain and is involved in the detection of and adaptation to environmental change[4].

Investigations of invertebrates possessing early homologs of the AhR suggest that the AhR evolutionarily functioned in regulation of the cell cycle, cellular proliferation and differentiation, and cell-to-cell communications (Hahn et al 2002). However, critical functions in angiogenesis, regulation of the immune system, neuronal processes, metabolism, development of the heart and other organ systems, and detoxification have emerged sometime in early vertebrate evolution (Duncan et al., 1998; Emmons et al., 1999; Lahvis and Bradfield, 1998).

The molecular Initiating Event




Figure 1: The molecular mechanism of activation of gene expression by AHR.

&nbsp;



The molecular mechanism for AHR-mediated activation of gene expression is presented in Figure 1. In its unliganded form, the AHR is part of a cytosolic complex containing heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), the HSP90 co-chaperone p23 and AHR-interacting protein (AIP)[6]. Upon ligand binding, the AHR migrates to the nucleus where it dissociates from the cytosolic complex and forms a heterodimer with ARNT[7]. The AHR-ARNT complex then binds to a xenobiotic response element (XRE) found in the promoter of an AHR-regulated gene and recruits co-regulators such as CREB binding protein/p300, steroid receptor co-activator (SRC) 1, SRC-2, SRC-3 and nuclear receptor interacting protein 1, leading to induction or repression of gene expression[6]. Expression levels of several genes, including phase I (e.g. cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A, CYP1B, CYP2A) and phase II enzymes (e.g. uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UDP-GT), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)), as well as genes involved in cell proliferation (transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin-1 beta), cell cycle regulation (p27, jun-B) and apoptosis (Bax), are regulated through this mechanism [6][8][7][9].

AHR Isoforms


	Over time the AhR has undergone gene duplication and diversification in vertebrates, which has resulted in multiple clades of AhR, namely AhR1, AhR2, and AhR3 (Hahn 2002).
	Fishes and birds express AhR1s and AhR2s, while mammals express a single AhR that is homologous to the AhR1 (Hahn 2002; Hahn et al 2006).
	The AhR3 is poorly understood and known only from some cartilaginous fishes (Hahn 2002).
	Little is known about diversity of AhRs in reptiles and amphibians (Hahn et al 2002).
	In some taxa, subsequent genome duplication events have further led to multiple isoforms of AhRs in some species, with up to four isoforms of the AhR (&alpha;, &beta;, &delta;, &gamma;) having been identified in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) (Hansson et al 2004).
	Although homologs of the AhR have been identified in some invertebrates, compared to vertebrates these AhRs have differences in binding of ligands in the species investigated to date (Hahn 2002; Hahn et al 1994).


&nbsp;

Roles of isoforms in birds:

Two AHR isoforms (AHR1 and AHR2) have been identified in the black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes), great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)[10]. AHR1 mRNA levels were similar in the kidney, heart, lung, spleen, brain, gonad and intestine from the great cormorant but were lower in muscle and pancreas. AHR2 expression was mainly observed in the liver, but was also detected in gonad, brain and intestine. AHR1 levels represented a greater proportion (80%) of total AHR levels than AHR2 in the cormorant liver[10], and while both AHR isoforms bound to TCDD, AHR2 was less effective at inducing TCDD-dependent transactivation compared to AHR1 in black-footed albatross, great cormorant and domestic chicken[11][10].


	AhR1 and AhR2 both bind and are activated by TCDD in vitro (Yasui et al 2007).
	AhR1 has greater binding affinity and sensitivity to activation by TCDD relative to AhR2 (Yasui et al 2007).
	AhR1 is believed to mediate toxicities of DLCs, while AhR2 has no known role in toxicities (Farmahin et al 2012; Farmahin et al 2013; Manning et al 2012).


Roles of isoforms in fishes:


	AhR1 and AhR2 both bind and are activated by TCDD in vitro (Bak et al 2013; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Karchner et al 1999; 2005).
	AhR1 has greater sensitivity to activation by TCDD than AhR2 in red seabream (Pagrus major), white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) (Bak et al 2013; Doering et al 2014; 2015)
	AhR2 has greater binding affinity or activation by TCDD than AhR1 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) (Karchner et al 1999; 2005).
	AhR2 is believed to mediate toxicities in fishes, while AhR1 has no known role in toxicities. Specifically, knockdown of AhR2 protects against toxicities of dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), while knockdown of AhR1 offers no protection (Clark et al 2010; Prasch et al 2003; Van Tiem &amp; Di Giulio 2011).


Roles of isoforms in amphibians and reptiles:


	Less is known about AhRs of amphibians or reptiles.
	AhR1 is believed to mediate toxicities in amphibians (Hahn 2002; Lavine et al 2005; Oka et al 2016; Shoots et al 2015). However, all AhRs of amphibians that have been investigated have very low affinity for TCDD (Hahn 2002; Lavine et al 2005; Oka et al 2016; Shoots et al 2015).
	Both AhR1s and AhR2 of American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) are activated by agonists with comparable sensitivities (Oka et al 2016). AhRs of no other reptiles have been investigated.

Transactivation Reporter Gene Assays (recommended approach)

Transient transfection transactivation

Transient transfection transactivation is the most common method for evaluating nuclear receptor activation[12]. Full-length AHR cDNAs are cloned into an expression vector along with a reporter gene construct (chimeric luciferase, P-lactamase or CAT reporter vectors containing the appropriate response elements for the gene of interest). There are a number of commercially available cell lines that can serve as recipients for these vectors (CV-1, HuH7, FLC-7, LS174T, LS180 MCF-7, HEC1, LLC-PK1, HEK293, HepG2, and Caco-2 cells)[12]. The greatest advantage of using transfected cells, rather than primary cell cultures, is the assurance that the nuclear receptor of interest is responsible for the observed induction. This would not be possible in a primary cell culture due to the co-regulation of different receptors for the same target genes. This model makes it easy to compare the responsiveness of the AHR across multiple species under the same conditions simply by switching out the AHR clone. One disadvantage to the transient transfection assay is the inherent variability associated with transfection efficiency, leading to a movement towards the use of stable cell lines containing the nuclear receptor and reporter gene linked to the appropriate response elements[12].

Luciferase reporter gene (LRG) assay

The described luciferase reporter gene (LRG) assays have been used to investigate activation of AhRs of:


	Humans&nbsp;(Homo sapiens)&nbsp;(Abnet et al 1999)&nbsp;
	Species of birds, namely chicken (Gallus gallus), ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), and common tern (Sterna hirundo)&nbsp;(Farmahin et al 2012; Manning et al 2013), Mutant AhR1s with ligand binding domains resembling those of at least 86 avian species have also been investigated (Farmahin et al 2013). AhR2s of birds have only been investigated in black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes) and common cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) (Yasio et al 2007).
	American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is the only reptile for which&nbsp;AhR activation&nbsp;has been investigated&nbsp;(Oka et al 2016), AhR1A, AhR1B, and AhR2 of American alligator were assayed (Oka et al 2016).
	AhR1 of two amphibians have been investigated, namely African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) and salamander (Ambystoma mexicanum) (Lavine et al 2005; Shoots et al 2015; Ohi et al 2003),
	AhR1s and AhR2s of several species of fish have been investigated, namely Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod), white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), rainbow trout (Onchorhynchys mykiss), red seabream (Pagrus major), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), and zebrafish (Danio rerio) (Andreasen et al 2002; Abnet et al 1999; Bak et al 2013; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Evans et al 2005; Hansson &amp; Hahn 2008; Karchner et al 1999; Tanguay et al 1999; Wirgin et al 2011).


For demonstrative purposes, a luciferase reporter gene assay used to measure AHR1-mediated transactivation for avian species is described here. However, comparable assays are utilized for investigating AHR1s and AHR2s of all taxa. A monkey kidney cell line (Cos-7) that has low endogenous AHR1 expression was transfected with the appropriate avian AHR1 clone, cormorant ARNT1, a CYP1A5 firefly luciferase reporter construct and a Renilla luciferase vector to control for transfection efficiency. After seeding, the cells were exposed to DLC and luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer. Luminescence, which is proportional to the extent of AHR activation, is expressed as the ratio of firefly luciferase units to Renilla luciferase units [13]. This particular assay was modified from its original version to increase throughput efficiency; (a) cells were seeded in 96-well plates rather than Petri dishes or 48- well plates, (b) DLCs were added directly to the wells without changing the cell culture medium, and (c) the same 96-well plates were used to measure luminescence without lysing the cells and transferring to another plate. Similar reporter gene assays have been used to measure AHR1 activation in domestic and wild species of birds, including the chicken, ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), great cormorant, black-footed albatross and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus).[14][13][15][11][16][17]

Transactivation in stable cell lines

Stable cell lines have been developed and purified to the extent that each cell contains both the nuclear receptor and appropriate reporter vector, eliminating the variability associated with transfection [12]. A stable human cell line containing a luciferase reporter driven by multiple dioxin response elements has been developed that is useful in identifying AhR agonists and antagonists[18]. An added benefit of this model is the potential to multiplex 3 assays in a single well: receptor activation, cell viability and enzyme activity[12]. Such assays are used extensively in drug discovery due to their high throughput efficiency, and may serve just as useful for risk assessment purposes.

Ligand-Binding Assays

Ligand binding assays measure the ability of a test compound to compete with a labeled, high-affinity reference ligand for the LBD of a nuclear receptor. It is important to note that ligand binding does not necessitate receptor activation and therefore cannot distinguish between agonists and antagonists; however, binding affinities of AHR ligands are highly correlated with chemical potencies[19] and can explain differences in species sensitivities to DLCs[20][21][22]; they are therefore worth mentioning. Binding affinity and efficacy have been used to develop structure-activity relationships for AHR disruption[20][23] that are potentially useful in risk-assessment. There has been tremendous progress in the development of ligand-binding assays for nuclear receptors that use homogenous assay formats (no wash steps) allowing for the detection of low-affinity ligands, many of which do not require a radiolabel and are amenable to high throughput screening[24][12]. This author however was unable to find specific examples of such assays in the context of AHR binding and therefore some classic radioligand assays are described instead.

Hydroxyapatite (HAP) binding assay

The HAP binding assay makes use of an in vitro transcription/translation method to synthesize the AHR protein, which is then incubated with radiolabeled TDCPP and a HAP pellet. The occupied protein adsorbs to the HAP and the radioactivity is measured to determine saturation binding. An additional ligand can also be included in the mixture in order to determine its binding affinity relative to TCDD (competitive binding)[25][22]. This assay is simple, repeatable and reproducible; however, it is insensitive to weak ligand-receptor interactions[22][21][26].

Whole cell filtration binding assay

Dold and Greenlee[27] developed a method to detect specific binding of TCDD to whole mammalian cells in culture and was later modified by Farmahin et al.[21] for avian species. The cultured cells are incubated with radiolabeled TCDD with or without the presence of a competing ligand and filtered. The occupied protein adsorbs onto the filter and the radioactivity is measured to determine saturation binging and/or competitive binding. This assay is able to detect weak ligand-receptor interactions that are below the detection limit of the HAP assay[21].

Protein-DNA Interaction Assays

The active AHR complexed with ARNT can be measured using protein-DNA interaction assays. Two methods are described in detail by Perez-Romero and Imperiale[28]. Chromatin immunoprecipitation measures the interaction of proteins with specific genomic regions in vivo. It involves the treatment of cells with formaldehyde to crosslink neighboring protein-protein and protein-DNA molecules. Nuclear fractions are isolated, the genomic DNA is sheared, and nuclear lysates are used in immunoprecipitations with an antibody against the protein of interest. After reversal of the crosslinking, the associated DNA fragments are sequenced. Enrichment of specific DNA sequences represents regions on the genome that the protein of interest is associated with in vivo. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) provides a rapid method to study DNA-binding protein interactions in vitro. This relies on the fact that complexes of protein and DNA migrate through a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel more slowly than free DNA fragments. The protein-DNA complex components are then identified with appropriate antibodies. The EMSA assay was found to be consistent with the LRG assay in chicken hepatoma cells dosed with dioxin-like compounds[29].

In silico Approaches

In silico homology modeling of the ligand binding domain of the AHR in combination with molecular docking simulations can provide valuable insight into the transactivation-potential of a diverse array of AHR ligands.&nbsp; Such models have been developed for multiple AHR isoforms and ligands (high/low affinity, endogenous and synthetic, agonists and antagonists), and can accurately predict ligand potency based on their structure and physicochemical properties (Bonati et al 2017; Hirano et al 2015; Sovadinova et al 2006).

	dcterms:description	"""Structure and Function of ARNT


	The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) is a member of the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) family of proteins (Gu et al 2000).
	PAS proteins share highly conserved PAS domains (Gu et al 2000).
	PAS proteins act as transcriptional regulators in response to environmental and physiological cues (Gu et al 2000).
	ARNTs have numerous key roles in vertebrates related to responses to developmental and environmental cues.


Isoforms of ARNT:


	Over time ARNT has undergone gene duplication and diversification in vertebrates, which has resulted in three clades of ARNT, namely ARNT1, ARNT2, and ARNT3.
	Each clade can include multiple isoforms and splice variants (Hill et al 2009; Lee et al 2007; Lee et al 2011; Powel &amp; Hahn 2000; Tanguay et al 2000).
	ARNT1s have been demonstrated to function predominantly through heterodimerization with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 &alpha; (HIF1&alpha;) (Prasch et al 2004; 2006; Wang et al 1995).
	ARNT2s are believed to function predominantly through heterodimerization with Single Minded (SIM) (Hirose et al 1996).
	ARNT3s, which are also known as ARNT-like (ARNTL), Brain and Muscle ARNT-like-1 (BMAL1), or Morphine Preference 3 (MOP3), are believed to function predominantly through heterodimerization with Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK) (Gekakis et al 1998).


Roles of ARNTs in mammals:


	ARNT1 functions in normal vascular and hematopoietic development (Kozak et al 1997; Maltepe et al 1997; Abbott &amp; Buckalew 2000).
	ARNT2 functions in development of the hypothalamus and nervous system (Hosoya et al 2001; Keith et al 2001).
	ARNT3 functions in biological rhythms (Gekakis et al 1998).


Roles of ARNTs in other taxa:


	ARNTs have been demonstrated to have roles in development of the heart, brain, liver, and possibly the peripheral nervous system in zebrafish (Danio rerio) (Hill et al 2009).
	Roles of ARNTs in other taxa have not been sufficiently investigated to date.


Interaction with AHR


	Both ARNT1s and ARNT2s are able to heterodimerize with AhR and interact with dioxin-responsive elements on the DNA in in vitro systems (Hirose et al 1996; Lee et al 2007; Lee et al 2011; Prasch et al 2004).
	Selective knockdown of ARNTs in zebrafish (Danio rerio) demonstrates that ARNT1s, but not ARNT2s, are required for activation of the AhR in vivo (Prasch et al 2004; 2006).
	In limited investigations ARNT3 has not been demonstrated to interact with the AHR either in vivo or in vitro (Jain et al 1998).&nbsp;


Upon ligand binding, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) migrates to the nucleus where it dissociates from the cytosolic complex and forms a heterodimer with AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) (Mimura and Fujii-Kuriyama 2003). The AHR-ARNT complex then binds to a xenobiotic response element (XRE) found in the promoter of an AHR-regulated gene and recruits co-regulators such as CREB binding protein/p300, steroid receptor co-activator (SRC) 1, SRC-2, SRC-3 and nuclear receptor interacting protein 1, leading to induction or repression of gene expression (Fujii-Kuriyama and Kawajiri 2010). Expression levels of several genes, including phase I (e.g. cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A, CYP1B, CYP2A) and phase II enzymes (e.g. uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UDP-GT), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)), as well as genes involved in cell proliferation (transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin-1 beta), cell cycle regulation (p27, jun-B) and apoptosis (Bax), are regulated through this mechanism (Fujii-Kuriyama and Kawajiri 2010; Giesy et al. 2006; Mimura and Fujii-Kuriyama 2003; Safe 1994).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""AhR/ARNT heterodimerization can be measured in several ways:

1) The active AHR complexed with ARNT can be measured using protein-DNA interaction assays. Two methods are described in detail by Perez-Romero and Imperiale (Perez-Romero and Imperiale 2007). Chromatin immunoprecipitation measures the interaction of proteins with specific genomic regions in vivo. It involves the treatment of cells with formaldehyde to crosslink neighboring protein-protein and protein-DNA molecules. Nuclear fractions are isolated, the genomic DNA is sheared, and nuclear lysates are used in immunoprecipitations with an antibody against the protein of interest. After reversal of the crosslinking, the associated DNA fragments are sequenced. Enrichment of specific DNA sequences represents regions on the genome that the protein of interest is associated with in vivo. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) provides a rapid method to study DNA-binding protein interactions in vitro. This relies on the fact that complexes of protein and DNA migrate through a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel more slowly than free DNA fragments. The protein-DNA complex components are then identified with appropriate antibodies. The EMSA assay was found to be consistent with the luciferase reporter gene assay (in chicken hepatoma cells dosed with dioxin-like compounds (Heid et al. 2001).

2) Species-specific differences in dimerization and differences in dimerization between ARNT isoform&nbsp;and AhR isoform combinations have been assessed through luciferase reporter gene (LRG) assays utilizing&nbsp;COS-7 cells transfected with expression constructs of AhR and ARNT isoforms of mammals, birds, and fishes (Abnet et al 1999; Bak et al 2013; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Hansson &amp; Hahn 2008;&nbsp;Hirose et al 1996;&nbsp;Karchner et al 1999;&nbsp;Lee et al 2007; Lee et al 2011; Prasch et al 2004;&nbsp;Wirgin et al 2011). However, this method is indirect as it also includes binding of a ligand to the AhR, and interaction of the AhR/ARNT heterodimer with dioxin-responsive elements on the DNA.

	Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS; KEGG ID E.C. 1.14.99.1) is an enzyme that has two catalytic sites.
	Cyclooxygenase site (COX) catalyzes conversion of arachidonic acid into endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (Simmons et al 2004).
	Peroxidase active site converts PGG2 to PGH2 (KEGG reactions 1599, 1590). PGH2 is a precursor for synthesis of other prostaglandins (PGEs, PGFs), prostacyclin, and thromboxanes (Simmons et al 2004; Botting &amp; Botting 2011).
	There are two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2
	COX-2 is inducible by certain chemical exposures, inflammation, during discrete stages of gamete maturation, and more (Green et al 2012).
	However, COX biology is complex and important details of the pathway remain unknown (Grosser 2006).


COX Cardiovascular Roles:


	Prostaglandins which are catalyzed by COX and have roles in cellular homeostasis and in promoting inflammatory responses (Chien et al 2015; Smith et al 2000; Tilley et al 2001; Vane et al 1994).

This particular key event specifically refers to interaction with nuclear AR. &nbsp;Downstream KE responses to activation of membrane ARs may be different. The cellular site of action for the molecular initiating event is undefined.

Responses at the macromolecular level: Binding of a ligand, including xenobiotics that act as AR agonists, to the cytosolic AR mediates a conformational shift that facilitates dissociation from accompanying heat shock proteins and dimerization with another AR (Prescott and Coetzee 2006; Claessens et al. 2008; Centenera et al. 2008). Homodimerization unveils a nuclear localization sequence, allowing the AR-ligand complex to translocate to the nucleus and bind to androgen-response elements (AREs) (Claessens et al. 2008; Cutress et al. 2008). This elicits recruitment of additional transcription factors and transcriptional activation of androgen-responsive genes (Heemers and Tindall 2007).

AR paralogs:


	Most vertebrates have a single gene coding for nuclear AR. However, most fish have two AR genes (AR-A, AR-B) as a result of a whole genome duplication event after the split of Acipenseriformes from teleosts but before the divergence of Osteoglossiformes (Douard et al. 2008).
	AR-B has been lost in Cypriniformes, Siluriformes, Characiformes, and Salmoniformes (Douard et al. 2008).
	In Percomorphs, AR-B has accumulated significant substitutions in the both ligand binding and DNA binding domains (Douard et al. 2008).
	Differential ligand selectivity and subcellular localization has been reported for AR paralogs in some fish species (e.g., Bain et al. 2015), but the difference is not easily generalized based on available data in the literature.&nbsp;

	mmo:0000000	"""Measurement/detection:


	In vitro methods:

	
		OECD Test No. 458: Stably transfected human androgen receptor transcriptional activation assay for detection of androgen agonists and antagonists has been reviewed and validated by OECD and is well suited for detection of this key event (OECD 2016).
		Binding to the androgen receptor can be directly measured in cell free systems based on displacement of a radio-labeled standard (generally testosterone or DHT) in a competitive binding assay (e.g., (Olsson et al. 2005; Sperry and Thomas 1999; Wilson et al. 2007; Tilley et al. 1989; Kim et al. 2010).
		Cell based transcriptional activation assays are typically required to differentiate agonists from antagonists, in vitro. A number of reporter gene assays have been developed and used to screen chemicals for AR agonist and/or antagonist activity (e.g., (Wilson et al. 2002; van der Burg et al. 2010; Mak et al. 1999; Araki et al. 2005).
		Expression of androgen responsive proteins like spiggin in primary cell cultures has also been used to detect AR agonist activity (Jolly et al. 2006).
	
	
	In vivo methods:&nbsp;
	
		In fish, phenotypic masculinization of females has frequently been used as an indirect measurement of in vivo androgen receptor agonism.
		
			Development of nuptial tubercles, a dorsal fatpad, and a characteristic banding pattern has been observed in female fathead minnows exposed to androgen agonists (Ankley et al. 2003; Jensen et al. 2006; Ankley et al. 2010; LaLone et al. 2013; OECD 2012).
			Anal fin elongation in female western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) has similarly been viewed as evidence of AR activation (Raut et al. 2011; Sone et al. 2005).
			In medaka, development of papillary processes, which normally only appear on the second to seventh or eighth fin aray of the anal fin, has also been used as an indirect measure of androgen receptor agonism (OECD 2012).
			Production of the nest building glue, spiggin, in three female 3-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has also been well documented as an indicator of androgen receptor agonism (Jakobsson et al. 1999; Hahlbeck et al. 2004). Quantification of the spiggin protein in exposed female 3-spined stickleback&nbsp;or green fluorescence protein expression in&nbsp;a transgenic spg1-gfp&nbsp;medaka line (S&eacute;billot et al. 2014) can be used to detect androgen receptor agonism.
		
		
	
	
	High Throughput Screening
	
		‚ÄãMeasures of AR agonism have been included in high throughput screening programs, such as US EPA&#39;s Toxcast program. Toxcast assays relevant for screening chemicals for their ability to bind and/or activate the AR include:
		
			ATG_AR_TRANS A cell based assay that can differentiate agonism from antagonism
			NVS_NR_hAR A cell free assay using recombinant human AR. Can detect binding, but cannot distinguish agonism from antagonism.

Site of action: The site of action for the molecular initiating event is the ovarian granulosa cells.
While many vertebrates have a single isoform of aromatase, fish are known to have two isoforms. CYP19a1a is predominantly expressed in ovary while cyp19a1b is predominantly expressed in brain (Callard et al. 2001; Cheshenko et al. 2008). For the purposes of this MIE, when applied to fish, the assumed effect is on cyp19a1a. However, given that both isoforms show similar sensitivity to aromatase inhibitors (Hinfray et al. 2006) and catalyze the same reaction, discrimination of specific isoforms is not viewed as critical in relative to determining downstream key events resulting from aromatase inhibition in ovarian granulosa cells.
Responses at the macromolecular level: Aromatase catalyzes three sequential oxidation steps (i.e., KEGG reactions R02501, R04761, R03087 or R01840, R04759, R02351; http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) involved in the conversion of C-19 androgens (e.g., testosterone, androstenedione) to C-18 estrogens (e.g., 17Œ≤-estradiol, estrone). Aromatase inhibitors interfere with one or more of these reactions, leading to reduced efficiency in converting C-19 androgens into C-18 estrogens.  Therefore, inhibition of aromatase activity results in decreased rate of 17Œ≤-estradiol (and presumably estrone) production by the ovary.

Cytokines may act on the cells that secrete them (autocrine action), on nearby cells (paracrine action), as well as on distant cells (endocrine action). Cytokines can act synergistically or antagonistically, and secretion from one cell can trigger upregulation of a further range of cytokines from the same cell or others [1]. Most cells in the body are able to secrete them, and several subfamilies belong to the group of cytokines, such as chemokines, interferons, interleukins, tumor necrosis factors (TNF), transforming growth factors (TGF) and colony-stimulating factors. They are important players in modulating fundamental biological processes, including body growth, adiposity, lactation, hematopoiesis, and also inflammation and immunity[2]. Damaged cells, such as apoptotic cells, can trigger the upregulation and release of cytokines to induce the inflammatory response. An important receptor responsible for cell death-related cytokine regulation is Fas, a cell surface glycoprotein which belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family. The role of Fas in the onset of inflammation by upregulating inflammatory cytokines is increasingly discussed. Fas-activation can trigger the production of MCP-1 and IL-8 and its associated chemotaxis of phagocytes toward apoptotic cells[3].
TNF-Œ± is an inflammatory mediator that can be secreted by many cell types, including hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. TNF-induced cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, GMCSF, CXCL1, and RANTES, can trigger immune responses by producing acute phase proteins and recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and basophils to the site of inflammation. Moreover, an increased production of monocytes/macrophages from bone marrow is triggered[3]. 
On the other hand, inflammation can be suppressed by cytokines and mediators such as IL-10 and TGF-Œ≤. In the liver, TGF-Œ≤1 is the most abundant isoform and is secreted by immune cells, stellate cells, and epithelial cells. IL-10 inhibits T cell-, monocyte-, and macrophage-mediated functions and has been detected in several liver cells, in¬¨cluding hepatocytes, stellate cells, and Kupffer cells [2].

The term oxidative stress indicates the outcome of oxidative damage to biologically relevant macromolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. This occurs when oxidative stress-related molecules, generated in the extracellular environment or within the cell, exceed cellular antioxidant defenses. Major reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion, as well as 4-hydroxy- 2,3-nonenal (HNE) and related 4-hydroxy-2,3-alkenals (HAKs), major aldehydic end-products of lipid peroxidation, can act as potential mediators able to affect signal transduction pathways as well as the proliferative and functional response of target cells. H2O2 and superoxide anion may be also generated as molecular messengers within the cell as part of the cellular response to defined growth factors, cytokines and other mediators. The final consequence at tissue, cellular and molecular level is primarily affected by the steady state concentration of oxidative stress-related molecules. The main biological targets of free radicals are proteins, lipids and DNA.

Major consequences of reaction of ROS, HAKs and NO with biologically relevant macromolecules that can mediate pathophysiological effects:

ROS: DNA: oxidation, strand breaks, genotoxicity Proteins: oxidation, fragmentation, formation of carbonyls Lipids: lipid peroxidation and degradation

HAKs: DNA: adducts (low doses), strand breaks, genotoxicity (high doses) Proteins: adducts (Michael type reactions on Lys, Cys and His residues)

NO: DNA: oxidation, strand breaks Proteins: oxidation, nitrosation, nitration (nytrosylation of tyrosine) Lipids: lipid peroxidation and degradation

Continued oxidative stress can lead to chronic inflammation. Oxidative stress can activate a variety of transcription factors including NF-&kappa;B, AP-1, p53, HIF-1&alpha;, PPAR-&gamma;, &beta;-catenin/Wnt, and Nrf2. Activation of these transcription factors can lead to the expression of over 500 different genes, including those for growth factors, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which can activate inflammatory pathways.

Glutathione (GSH) oxidation refers to the conversion of reduced glutathione to its oxidized form glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in the presence of oxidative species. GSH plays an important role as an anti-oxidant in regulating cellular redox homeostasis, and is mainly present in the cell as the reduced form (98%). Deficiency in GSH or a decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio results in decreased anti-oxidant function and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, thus making it a marker of cellular redox status. An imbalance in GSH/GSSG ratio has been implicated in the onset and progression of human diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, pulmonary diseases and cardiovascular diseases (Ballatori et al., 2009; Kalinina et al., 2014)

measuring oxidative stress 

Agents for ROS detection are primarily fluorescence based, but recently luminescent based detections have been introduced. The biggest difficulty reported with much of the cellular ROS research has been with the lack of reporter agents specific for discrete molecules. ROS moieties by their nature are reactive with a number of different molecules; as such designing reporter agents has been difficult. With more specific chemistries, particularly for hydrogen peroxide, the specific mechanisms for regulation will be elucidated. 

Reduced glutathione (GSH) is regenerated from its oxidized form (GSSH) by the action of an NADPH dependent reductase GSSH + NADPH + H+ &agrave; 2 GSH + NADP+ Due to the rapid nature of the reduction of GSSH relative to its synthesis or secretion, the ratio of GSH to GSSH is a good indicator of oxidative stress within cells. GSH and GSSH levels can be determined by HPLC, capillary electrophoresis, or biochemically in microplates. Several different assays have been designed to measure glutathione in samples. By using a luciferin derivative in conjunction with glutathione S-transferase enzyme the amount of GSH would be proportional to the luminescent signal generated when luciferase is added in a subsequent step. Total glutathione can be determined colorimetrically by reacting GSH with DTNB (Ellman&rsquo;s reagent) in the presence of glutathione reductase. Glutathione reductase reduces GSSH to GSH, which then reacts with DTNB to produce a yellow colored 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB), which absorbs at 412 nm. 

Lipid peroxidation is one of the most widely used indicators of free radical formation, a key indicator of oxidative stress. Measurement of lipid peroxidation has historically relied on the detection of thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reactive compounds such as malondialdehyde generated from the decomposition of lipid peroxidation products. While this method is controversial in that it is quite sensitive, but not necessarily specific to MDA, it remains the most widely used means to determine lipid peroxidation. This reaction, which takes place under acidic conditions at 90-100&ordm;C, results in an adduct that can be measured colorimetrically at 532 nm or by fluorescence using a 530 nm excitation wavelength and a 550 nm emission wavelength. A number of commercial assay kits are available for this assay using absorbance or fluorescence detection technologies. The formation of F2-like prostanoid derivatives of arachidonic acid, termed F2-isoprostanes (IsoP) has been shown to be specific for lipid peroxidation. Unlike the TBA assay, measurement of IsoP appears to be specific to lipid peroxides, they are stable and are not produced by any enzymatic pathway making interpretation easier. There have been a number of commercial ELISA kits developed for IsoPs, but interfering agents in samples requires partial purification of samples prior to running the assay. The only reliable means for detection is through the use of GC/MS, which makes it expensive and limits throughput. 

Superoxide detection is based on the interaction of superoxide with some other compound to create a measurable result. The reduction of ferricytochrome c to ferrocytochrome c has been used in a number of situations to assess the rate of superoxide formation. While not completely specific for superoxide this reaction can be monitored colorimetrically at 550 nm. Chemiluminescent reactions have been used for their potential increase in sensitivity over absorbance-based detection methods. The most widely used chemiluminescent substrate is Lucigenin, but this compound has a propensity for redox cycling, which has raised doubts about its use in determining quantitative rates of superoxide production. Coelenterazine has also been used as a chemiluminescent substrate. Hydrocyanine dyes are fluorogenic sensors for superoxide and hydroxyl radical. These dyes are synthesized by reducing the iminium cation of the cyanine (Cy) dyes with sodium borohydride. While weakly fluorescent, upon oxidation their fluorescence intensity increases 100 fold. In addition to being fluorescent, oxidation also converts the molecule from being membrane permeable to an ionic impermeable moiety. The most characterized of these probes are Hydro-Cy3 and Hydro-Cy5. 

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the most important ROS in regards to mitogenic stimulation or cell cycle regulation. There are a number of fluorogenic substrates, which serve as hydrogen donors that have been used in conjunction with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme to produce intensely fluorescent products. The more commonly used substrates include diacetyldichloro-fluorescein, homovanillic acid, and Amplex&reg; Red. In these examples, increasing amounts of H2O2 form increasing amounts of fluorescent product. 

Nitric Oxide The free radical nitric oxide (&bull;NO) is produced by a number of different cell types with a variety of biological functions. Regardless of the source or role, the free radical &bull;NO has a very short half life (t&frac12;= 4 seconds), reacting with several different molecules normally present to form either nitrate (NO3-) or nitrite (NO2-) A commonly used method for the indirect determination of &bull;NO is the determination of its composition products nitrate and nitrite colorimetrically. This reaction requires that nitrate (NO3) first be reduced to nitrite (NO2), typically by the action of nitrate reductase. Subsequent determination of nitrite by a two step process provides information on the &ldquo;total&rdquo; of nitrate and nitrite. In the presence of hydrogen ions nitrite forms nitrous acid, which reacts with sulfanilamide to produce a diazonium ion. This then coupled to N-(1-napthyl) ethylenediamine to form the chromophore which absorbs at 543 nm. Nitrite only determinations can then be made in a parallel assay where the samples were not reduced prior to the colorimetric assay. Actual nitrate levels are then calculated by the subtraction of nitrite levels from the total. [4]

	dcterms:description	"""Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS; KEGG ID E.C. 1.14.99.1; [1]) is an enzyme that has two catalytic sites. Cyclooxygenase site (COX) catalyzes conversion of arachidonic acid into endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (Simmons et al., 2004). Peroxidase active site converts PGG2 to PGH2 (KEGG reactions 1599, 1590, [2]). PGH2 is a precursor for synthesis of other prostaglandins (e.g., PGEs, PGFs; [3]), prostacyclin and thromboxanes (Simmons et al., 2004; Botting and Botting 2011). Two of the COX isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) encoded by two different genes (ptgs1 and ptgs2) are well characterized. Ptgs1 is typically expressed constitutively and is involved in maintenance of homeostatic functions. Ptgs2 is largely inducible (e.g., by inflammation, during discrete stages of gamete maturation etc.), but can also be constitutively expressed (e.g., kidney; Green et al, 2012). In mammals, COX-3 (a splice of COX-1) has also been identified (Chandrasekharan et al., 2002), but its function is not well characterized and it is not likely to have prostaglandin producing capacity (Bacchi et al., 2012). 
Most COX inhibitors interfere with COX site via competitive inhibition (compete for active site with arachidonic acid), but some are capable of covalent modification of COX (Simmons et al., 2004; Willoughby et al., 2011). The inhibition of COX can lead to reduced efficiency of converting arachidonic acid to PGG2. Therefore inhibition of COX can decrease the rate of prostaglandin production (reviewed Simmons et al, 2004; Bacchi et al., 2012).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Multiple methods have been developed to investigate inhibition of COX activity - the cyclooxygenase (COX) reaction can be monitored by measurement of oxygen consumption, peroxidase co-substrate oxidation or prostaglandin (PG) detection (e.g., Jang and Pezzuto, 1997; Cuendet et al., 2006). Commercial kits from many suppliers deploying a variety of methods are available for purchase (e.g., Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). Repeatability and reproducibility of these commercial assays is well documented ‚Äì the data generated by assays is reproducible and interassay variation is typically below 5%. The preparation of fish ovarian tissue for COX activity assay is described by Lister and Van der Kraak (2008).

Responses at the macromolecular level: Estrogen receptor antagonists have been shown to interact with the ligand binding domain of ERs. However, those interactions occur at different contact sites than those of estrogen agonists, leading to a different conformation in the transactivation domain (Brzozowski et al. 1997; Katzenellenbogen 1996).

Characterization of chemical properties: Two broad categories of ER antagonists have been described. Type I, like tamoxifen act as mixed agonists and antagonists. Type II, like ICI164384 are pure antagonists (Katzenellenbogen 1996). Due to their potential utility for treating estrogen-dependent breast cancers and other estrogen-related disease states as well as concerns regarding endocrine disruption, there is an extensive body of literature on the identification and design of chemical structures that act as ER antagonists (e.g., (Brooks et al. 1987; Brooks and Skafar 2004; Lloyd et al. 2006; Sodero et al. 2012; Vedani et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2006).

	The BG1luc estrogen receptor transactivation test method for identifying estrogen receptor agonists and antagonists (OECD Test Guideline 457) has been validated by the National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) and Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) as an appropriate assay for detecting ER antagonism. (OECD, 2012b).
	Other human ER-based transactivation assays that have been used to detect ER&alpha; antagonism include the T47D-Kbluc assay (Wilson et al. 2004); ER&alpha; CALUX assay (van der Burg et al. 2010); MELN assay (Witters et al. 2010); and the yeast estrogen screen (YES; (De Boever et al. 2001)). Each of these assays have undergone some level of validation.
	In aquatic ecotoxicology, vitellogenin synthesis in primary fish liver cells and liver slices has also been used to screen for anti-estrogenic activity (e.g., (Bickley et al. 2009; Navas and Segner 2006; Schmieder et al. 2000; Schmieder et al. 2004; Sun et al. 2010). Although these approaches have generally not been subject to as much formal validation as human ER-based transactivation assays, in the case of fish-specific AOPs linked to this key event, these measures of anti-estrogenicity may be more directly relevant to predicting other key events in the pathway.

	dcterms:description	"""The LXR receptor
Liver X receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors of the nuclear receptor superfamily first identified in 1994 in rat liver (Apfel et al. 1994, Song 1994). There are two LXR isoforms termed a and √ü (NR1H3 and NR1H2) which upon activation form heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and bind to the LXR response element found in the promoter region of the target genes (Baranowski 2008). LXRs were shown to function as sterol sensors protecting the cells from cholesterol overload by stimulating  reverse cholesterol transport and activating its conversion to bile acids in the liver (Baranowski 2008). 
LXRa expression is restricted to liver, kidney, intestine, fat tissue, macrophages, lung, and spleen and is highest in liver, hence the name liver X receptor a (LXRa). LXRŒ≤ is expressed in almost all tissues and organs, hence the early name UR (ubiquitous receptor) (Ory 2004). The different pattern of expression suggests that LXRa and LXRŒ≤ have different roles in regulating physiological function. This is also supported from the observation that LXRa deficient mice do not develop hepatic steatosis when treated with LXR agonist that activates both types (Lund et al. 2006) and consequently the role of the two isoforms in relation to adverse effects could be different.


The molecular initiating event
Generally speaking chemicals that are able to act through NRs are usually specific ligands. These chemicals are mainly lipophilic and they mimic the action of natural hormones. However, in some cases hydrophilic chemicals (like phthalates) are also capable to act as ligands in NRs due to the molecular structure of the proteins and the pocket sites of the receptors.  
The molecular initiating event in the presented MoA is the binding to the LXR or the permissive RXR of the LXR-RXR dimer leading to activation. LXR activation can be achieved via a wide range of endogenous neutral and acidic ligands as shown by crystallographic analysis (Williams et al. 2003). There are known endogenous but also synthetic ligands that can act as agonists. Endogenous agonists for this receptor are the oxysterols (oxidized cholesterol derivatives like 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol, and cholestenoic acid) mainly with similar affinity for the two isoforms (Baranowski 2008). Oxysterols bind directly to the typical hydrophobic pocket in the C-terminal domain (Williams et al. 2003). Other endogenous ligands are the D-glucose and D-Glucose-6-phosphate (Mitro 2007). However, the hydrophilic nature of glucose and its low affinity for LXR present a challenge to the central dogma about the nature of the NR-ligand interaction (Lazar &amp; Wilson 2007). Unsaturated fatty acids have also been shown to bind and regulate LXRa activity in cells. However, in contrast to the role of oxysterols, the biological relevance of this observation has not been established in vivo (Pawar et al. 2003). The function of LXRs is also modulated by many currently used drugs such as statins, fibrates, and thazolidinedione derivatives (Jamroz-Wi≈õniewska et al. 2007). Some synthetic LXR agonists have been developed like the non-steroidal agonists T0901317 and GW3965 (Schultz et al 2000, Collins et al. 2002). LXR forms a permissive dimer with the RXR which means that chemicals that can activate this receptor can trigger the same pathway as the LXR agonists. The endogenous RXR agonist is 9-cis-retinoic acid (Heyman et al. 1992) while synthetic agonists include LGD1069 and LG100268 (Boehm et al. 1994 and 1995).
In addition to the agonist binding in the LXR there are other mechanisms for its control. LXRa gene promoter contains also functional peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) a and Œ≥ agonists were shown to stimulate LXRa expression in human and rodent (Baranowski 2008). Control of the LXRa expression is also dependent on insulin and post-translationally by protein kinase A that phosphorylates receptor protein at two sites thereby impairing its dimerization and DNA-binding (Baranowski 2008).


Identification of the site of action
As already mentioned above LXR isoforms are expressed in various tissues but in relation to the presented MoA we refer to LXRs that are expressed in the hepatocytes.  
Nuclear receptors may be classified into two broad classes according to their sub-cellular distribution in the absence of ligand. Type I NRs (like ER and AhR) are located in the cytosol (and they are translocated into the nucleus after ligand binding) while type II NRs like LXRs (but also PXR, PPARa and PPARŒ≥) are located in the nucleus of the cell. 
The specific site of binding and the affinity of a ligand for the LXRs depend on the structure of the ligand.


Binding in the LXREs and target genes transcription
Upon ligand-induced activation both isoforms form obligate heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and regulate gene expression through binding to LXR response elements  (LXREs) in the promoter regions of the target genes (Fig. 1). The LXRE consists of two idealized hexanucleotide sequences (AGGTCA) separated by four bases (DR-4 element).

Auto-regulation of the LXRa
Human specific auto-regulated expression specifically of the LXRa has been demonstrated from several studies (Laffitte et al. 2001, Whitney et al. 2001, Li et al. 2002, Kase et al.  2007). Human LXRa gene promoter has a functional LXRE activated by both LXRa and Œ≤. In addition human liver LXRa expression is induced by both natural and synthetic LXR agonists.

In addition, CD36 can bind a variety of molecules including acetylated low density lipoproteins (LDL), collagen and phospholipids [3]. CD36 has been shown to be expressed in liver tissue [4], [5]. It is located in lipid rafts and non-raft domains of the cellular plasma membrane and most likely facilitates LCFA transport by accumulating LCFA on the outer surface [6], [7], [8]. 
FAT/CD36 gene is a liver specific target of LXR activation [9]. Studies have confirmed that the lipogenic effect of LXR and activation of FAT/CD36 was not a simple association, since the effect of LXR agonists on increasing hepatic and circulating levels of triglycerides and free fatty acids (FFAs) was largely abolished in FAT/CD36 knockout mice suggesting that intact expression and/or activation of FAT/CD36 is required for the steatotic effect of LXR agonists [10], [11]. In addition to the well-defined pathogenic role of FAT/CD36 in hepatic steatosis in rodents the human up-regulation of the FAT/CD36 in NASH patients is confirmed [12]. There are now findings that can accelerate the translation of FAT/CD36 metabolic functions determined in rodents to humans [13] and suggest that the translocation of this fatty acid transporter to the plasma membrane of hepatocytes may contribute to liver fat accumulation in patients with NAFLD and HCV [14]. In addition, hepatic FAT/CD36 up-regulation is significantly associated with insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and increased steatosis in patients with NASH and HCV G1 (Hepatitis C Virus Genotype1) with fatty liver. Recent data show that CD36 is also increased in the liver of morbidly obese patients and correlated to free FA levels [15].

This finding is demonstrated from the absence of triglyceride accumulation on SREBP-1c (-/-) mice [1], [2], [3], [4].
However there is evidence that this effect is not induced in the embryonic state indicating a different role of the SREBP-1c between embryonic and adult life [5]. It is also suggested that for lipogenic genes, SREBP-1c acts together with ChREBP [6]. In addition, in STZ diabetic mice, adenovirus-mediated over-expression of SREBP-1c in the liver resulted in an increase of lipogenic enzyme expression with an increase of the triglyceride hepatic content and a marked decrease in the hyperglycaemia of diabetic mice mimicking perfectly the effect of an insulin injection [7].
Finally there are a number of studies that demonstrated that SREBP-1c is essential for glucokinase (GK) expression and that it is a mediator of insulin action [8], [9].

	dcterms:description	"""Biological state

The Peroxisome Proliferator Activated receptor &gamma; (PPAR&gamma;) belongs to Peroxisome Proliferator Activated receptors (PPARs; NR1C) steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor superfamily of transcription factors, which respond to specific ligands by altering gene expression in a cell-specific manner. The PPAR&gamma; gene contains three promoters that yield three isoforms, namely, PPAR-&gamma;1, 2 and 3. PPAR-&gamma;1 and &gamma;3 RNA transcripts translate into the identical PPAR-&gamma;1 protein.

Biological compartments

PPAR&gamma; is abundantly expressed in adipose tissue, promoting adipocyte differentiation, but is also present in various cells and tissues, for review see (Braissant et al. 1996). PPAR&gamma; expression is tissue dependent (L Fajas et al. 1997), (Lluis Fajas, Fruchart, and Auwerx 1998). PPAR&gamma; is most highly expressed in white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue, where it is a master regulator of adipogenesis as well as a potent modulator of whole-body lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity (Evans, Barish, and Wang 2004), (Tontonoz and Spiegelman 2008). Whereas PPAR&gamma;1 is expressed in many tissues, the expression of PPAR&gamma;2 is restricted to adipose tissue under physiological conditions but can be induced in other tissues by a high-fat diet (Saraf et al. 2012).

General role in biology

PPAR&gamma; is activated after the binding of natural ligands such as polyunsaturated fatty acids and prostaglandin metabolites. It can also be activated by synthetic ligands such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or troglitazone) (Lehmann et al., 1995). PPAR&gamma; controls many vital processes such as glucose metabolism and inflammation as well as variety of developmental programs(Wahli &amp; Desvergne, 1999), (Rotman et al., 2008), (Wahli &amp; Michalik, 2012). This receptor itself is essential for developmental processes since targeted disruption of this gene results in embryo lethality, due in part to defective placental development, therefore modulation of PPAR&gamma; activity may impact endocrine regulated processes during development as well as later in life.

Is the assay reproducible? 

Binding of ligands to PPAR&gamma; is measured using binding assays in vitro and in silico, whereas the information about functional activation is derived from the transactivation using e.g. reporter assay with a reporter gene that demonstrates functional activation of a nuclear receptor by a specific compound. Binding of agonists within the ligand-binding site of PPARs causes a conformational change promoting binding to transcriptional coactivators. Conversely, binding of antagonists results in a conformation that favours the binding of corepressors (Yu &amp; Reddy, 2007) (Viswakarma et al., 2010. Transactivation assays are performed using the transient or stably transfected cells with the PPAR&gamma; expression plasmid and a reporter plasmid, correspondingly. There are also other methods that have been used to measure PPAR&gamma; activity, such as the Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) or commercially available PPAR&gamma; transcription factor assay kits, see Table 1. The transactivation (stable transfection) assay provides the most applicable OECD Level 2 assay aimed at identifying the initiating event leading to adverse outcome (LeBlanc, Norris, &amp; Kloas, 2011). Currently no internationally validated assays are available.

	dcterms:description	"""Liver fibrosis results from perpetuation of the normal wound healing response, as a result of repeated cycles of hepatocyte injury and repair and is a dynamic process, characterised by an excessive deposition of ECM (extracellular matrix) proteins including glycoproteins, collagens, and proteoglycans. 
It is usually secondary to hepatic injury and inflammation, and progresses at different rates depending on the aetiology of liver disease and is also influenced by environmental and genetic factors. If fibrosis continues, it disrupts the normal architecture of the liver, altering the normal function of the organ and ultimately leading to liver damage. Cirrhosis represents the final stage of fibrosis. It is characterised by fibrous septa which divide the parenchyma into regenerative nodules which leads to vascular modifications and portal hypertension with its complications of variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and hepatorenal syndrome. In addition, this condition is largely associated with hepatocellular carcinoma with a further increase in the relative mortality rate. [1] [2]
Liver fibrosis is an important health issue with clear regulatory relevance. The burden of disease attributable to liver fibrosis is quite high; progressive hepatic fibrosis, ultimately leading to cirrhosis, is a significant contributor to global health burden. [3] In the European Union, 0.1&#160;% of the population is affected by cirrhosis, the most advanced stage of liver fibrosis with full architectural disturbances. [4] Besides the epidemiological relevance, liver fibrosis also imposes a considerable economic burden on society. Indeed, the only curative therapy for chronic liver failure is liver transplantation. More than 5.500 orthotopic liver transplantations are currently performed in Europe on a yearly basis, costing up to ‚Ç¨100.000 the first year and ‚Ç¨10.000 yearly thereafter. [5]
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Liver biopsy is an important part of the evaluation of patients with a variety of liver diseases. Besides establishing the diagnosis, the biopsy is often used to assess the severity of the disease. Until recently it has been assumed that fibrosis is an irreversible process, so most grading and staging systems have relatively few stages and are not very sensitive for describing changes in fibrosis. In all systems, the stages are determined by both the quantity and location of the fibrosis, with the formation of septa and nodules as major factors in the transition from one stage to the next. The absolute amount of fibrous tissue is variable within each stage, and there is considerable overlap between stages. Commonly used systems are the Knodell score with 4 stages - no fibrosis (score 0) to fibrous portal expansion (score 2) to bridging fibrosis (score 3) and Cirrhosis (score 4) ‚Äì and the more sensitive Ishak fibrosis score with six stages - from no fibrosis (stage 0) over increasing fibrous expansion on portal areas (stages 1-2), bridging fibrosis (stages 3-4), and nodules (stage 5) to cirrhosis (stage 6)[6].
Liver biopsy is an invasive test with many possible complications and the potential for sampling error.
Noninvasive tests become increasingly precise in identifying the amount of liver fibrosis through computer-assisted image analysis.
Standard liver tests are of limited value in assessing the degree of fibrosis. 
Direct serologic markers of fibrosis include those associated with matrix deposition ‚Äî e.g.procollagen type III amino-terminal peptide
(P3NP), type I and IV collagens, laminin, hyaluronic acid, and chondrex. P3NP is the most widely studied marker of hepatic fibrosis.
Other direct markers of fibrosis are those associated with matrix degradation, ie, matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 3 (MMP-2, MMP- 3) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1 and 2 (TIMP-1, TIMP-2).These tests are not commercially available, and the components are not readily available in most clinical laboratories.
Some indirect markers that combine several parameters are available but not very reliable.  
Conventional imaging studies (ultrasonography and computed tomography) are not sensitive for fibrosis.
Hepatic elastography, a method for estimating liver stiffness, is a recent development in the noninvasive measurement of hepatic fibrosis. Currently, elastography can be accomplished by ultrasound or magnetic resonance.
Liver biopsy is still needed if laboratory testing and imaging studies are inconclusive.

	dcterms:description	"""Alkylation is the transfer of an alkyl group from one molecule to another. The alkyl group may be transferred as an alkyl carbocation, a free radical, a carbanion or a carbene (or their equivalents). Protein alkylation is the addition of an alkyl group to a protein amino acid. An alkyl group is any group derived from an alkane by removal of one hydrogen atom.
Alkylating agents are highly reactive chemicals that introduce alkyl groups into biologically active molecules and thereby prevent their proper functioning. Alkylating agents are classified according to their nucleophilic or electrophilic character. Nucleophilic alkylating agents deliver the equivalent of an alkyl anion (carbanion). These compounds typically can add to an electron-deficient carbon atom such as at a carbonyl group. Electrophilic alkylating agents deliver the equivalent of an alkyl cation. Alkyl halides can also react directly with amines to form C-N bonds; the same holds true for other nucleophiles such as alcohols, carboxylic acids, thiols, etc. Alkylation with only one carbon is termed methylation. [1]  [2]
Covalent protein alkylation by reactive electrophiles was identified as a key triggering event in chemical toxicity over 40 years ago and these reactions remain a major cause of chemical-induced toxicity. Interestingly, some chemical molecules produce significant protein covalent binding without causing toxicity, which suggests that only a critical subset of protein alkylation events contributes to injury. 
The  study  by Codreanu et al. (2014) describes an inventory of electrophile- mediated protein damage in intact cells and suggests that non-toxic covalent binding may largely be survivable damage to cytoskeletal components, whereas toxic covalent binding produces lethal injury by targeting protein synthesis and catabolism and possibly mitochondrial electron transport.

HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis
High Performance Liquid Chromatography ‚Äì electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) is the most popular MS technique. It combines the separation ability of HPLC along with the sensitivity and specificity of detection from MS. One of the advantages of HPLC-MS is that it allows samples to be rapidly desalted online, so no sample preparation is required unlike samples for GC-MS. Electrospray ionisation can produce singly or multiply charged ions. Typically high molecular weight compounds have multiple charges i.e. peptides and proteins. This technique is particularly suited to analysing polar molecules of mass &lt;2000 Dalton and requires no prior derivatisation in most applications.

MALDI-TOF/MS (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry) 
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is a soft ionization technique used in mass spectrometry, allowing the analysis of biomolecules (biopolymers such as DNA, proteins, peptides and sugars) and large organic molecules (such as polymers, dendrimers and other macromolecules), which tend to be fragile and fragment when ionized by more conventional ionization methods. MALDI methodology is a three-step process. First, the sample is mixed with a suitable matrix material and applied to a metal plate. Second, a pulsed laser irradiates the sample, triggering ablation and desorption of the sample and matrix material. Finally, the analyte molecules are ionized by being protonated or deprotonated in the hot plume of ablated gases, and can then be accelerated into whichever mass spectrometer is used to analyse them.

	dcterms:alternative	"Increased, Activation and Recruitment of Hepatic macrophages (Kupffer Cells)" ;
	dc:source	"AOPWiki" ;
	dcterms:description	"""Kupffer cells (KCs) are a specialized population of macrophages that reside in the liver; they were first described by Carl Wilhelm von Kupffer (1829‚Äì1902). [1]   
KCs constitute 80%-90% of the tissue macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system and account for approximately 15% of the total liver cell population [2] 
They play an important role in normal physiology and homeostasis as well as participating in the acute and chronic responses of the liver to toxic compounds. Activation of KCs results in the release of an array of inflammatory mediators, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species. This activation appears to modulate acute hepatocyte injury as well as chronic liver responses including hepatic cancer. Understanding the role KCs play in these diverse responses is key to understanding mechanisms of liver injury.[3]
Besides the release of inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, lysosomal and proteolytic enzymes KCs are a main source of TGF-Œ≤1 (transforming growth factor-beta 1, the most potent profibrogenic cytokine). In addition latent TGF-Œ≤1 can be activated by KC-secreted matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). [4] [5] through the release of biologically active substances that promote the pathogenic process.
Activated KCs also release ROS like superoxide generated by NOX (NADPH oxidase), thus contributing to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress also activates a variety of transcription factors like NF-Œ∫B, PPAR-Œ≥ leading to an increased gene expression for the production of growth factors, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. KCs express TNF-Œ± (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha), IL-1 (Interleukin-1) and MCP-1 (monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1), all being mitogens and chemoattractants for hepatic stellate ceells (HSCs) and induce the expression of PDGF receptors on HSCs which enhances cell proliferation.
Expressed TNF-Œ±, TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), and FasL (Fas Ligand) are not only pro-inflammatory active but also capable of inducing death receptor-mediated apoptosis in hepatocytes[6] [7][3]  
Under conditions of oxidative stress macrophages are further activated which leads to a more enhanced inflammatory response that again further activates KCs though cytokines (Interferon gamma (IFNŒ≥), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), TNF-Œ±), bacterial lipopolysaccharides, extracellular matrix proteins, and other chemical mediators. [8] [9]  
Besides KCs, the resident hepatic macrophages, infiltrating bone marrow-derived macrophages, originating from circulating monocytes are recruited to the injured liver via chemokine signals. KCs appear essential for sensing tissue injury and initiating inflammatory responses, while infiltrating Ly-6C+ monocyte-derived macrophages are linked to chronic inflammation and fibrogenesis.  The profibrotic functions of KCs (HSC activation via paracrine mechanisms) during chronic hepatic injury remain functionally relevant, even if the infiltration of additional inflammatory monocytes is blocked via pharmacological inhibition of the chemokine CCL2  [10] [11]
KC activation and macrophage recruitment are two separate events and both are necessary for fibrogenesis, but as they occur in parallel, they can be summarised as one KE.
Probably there is a threshold of KC activation and release above which liver damage is induced. Pre-treatment with gadolinium chloride (GdCl), which inhibits KC function, reduced both hepatocyte and sinusoidal epithelial cell injury, as well as decreased the numbers of macrophages appearing in hepatic lesions and inhibited TGF-Œ≤1 mRNA expression in macrophages. Experimental inhibition of KC function or depletion of KCs appeared to protect against chemical-induced liver injury.[12]

	dcterms:description	"""The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Œ≤) family of cytokines are ubiquitous, multifunctional, and essential to survival. They play important roles in growth and development, inflammation and repair, and host immunity. The mammalian TGF-Œ≤ isoforms (TGF-Œ≤1, Œ≤2 and Œ≤3) are secreted as latent precursors and have multiple cell surface receptors of which at least two mediate signal transduction. Autocrine and paracrine effects of TGF-Œ≤s can be modified by extracellular matrix, neighbouring cells and other cytokines. The vital role of the TGF-Œ≤ family is illustrated by the fact that approximately 50% of TGF-1 gene knockout mice die in utero and the remainder succumb to uncontrolled inflammation after birth. The role of TGF-Œ≤ in homeostatic and pathogenic processes suggests numerous applications in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases characterised by inflammation and fibrosis.
[1]
[2]
[3]
Abnormal TGF-Œ≤ regulation and function are implicated in a growing number of fibrotic and inflammatory pathologies, including pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy, congestive heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, Marfan syndrome, hypertrophic scars, systemic sclerosis, myocarditis, and Crohn‚Äôs disease.
[4]
TGF-Œ≤1 is a polypeptide member of the TGF-Œ≤ superfamily of cytokines. TGF-Œ≤ is synthesized as a non-active pro-form, forms a complex with two latent associated proteins latency-associated protein (LAP) and latent TGF- Œ≤ binding protein (LTBP) and undergoes protolithic cleavage by the endopeptidase furin to generate the mature TGF-Œ≤ dimer. Among the TGF-Œ≤s, six distinct isoforms have been discovered although only the TGF-Œ≤1, TGF-Œ≤2 and TGF-Œ≤3 isoforms are expressed in mammals, and their human genes are located on chromosomes 19q13, 1q41 and 14q24, respectively.
Out of the three TGF-Œ≤ isoforms (Œ≤1, Œ≤2 and Œ≤3) only TGF-Œ≤1 was linked to fibrogenesis and is the most potent fibrogenic factor for hepatic stellate cells.  
[5][6].
During fibrogenesis, tissue and blood levels of active TGF-Œ≤ are elevated and overexpression of TGF-Œ≤1 in transgenic mice can induce fibrosis. Additionally, experimental fibrosis can be inhibited by anti-TGF-Œ≤ treatments with neutralizing antibodies or soluble TGF-Œ≤ receptors [7][8][9][10]
TGF-Œ≤1 induces its own mRNA to sustain high levels in local sites of injury.The effects of TGF-Œ≤1 are classically mediated by intracellular signalling via Smad proteins. Smads 2 and 3 are stimulatory whereas Smad 7 is inhibitory. [11][12][13] Smad1/5/8, MAP kinase (mitogen-activated protein) and PI3 kinase are further signalling pathways in different cell types for TGF-Œ≤1 effects.
TGF-Œ≤ is found in all tissues, but is particularly abundant in bone, lung, kidney and placental tissue. TGF-Œ≤ is produced by many, but not all parenchymal cell types, and is also produced or released by infiltrating cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and platelets. Following wounding or inflammation, all these cells are potential sources of TGF-Œ≤. In general, the release and activation of TGF-Œ≤ stimulates the production of various extracellular matrix proteins and inhibits the degradation of these matrix proteins.

TGF-Œ≤ 1 is produced by every leukocyte lineage, including lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and its expression serves in both autocrine and paracrine modes to control the differentiation, proliferation, and state of activation of these immune cells. 
[15]
In the liver TGF-Œ≤1 is released by activated Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and platelets; in the further course of events also activated hepatic stellate cells express TGF-Œ≤1. Hepatocytes do not produce TGF-Œ≤1 but are implicated in intracellular activation of latent TGF-Œ≤1.[16][17][18][19][20] 
TGF-Œ≤1 is the most established mediator and regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) which further contributes to the production of extracellular matrix. It has been shown that TGF-Œ≤1 mediates EMT by inducing snail-1 transcription factor and tyrosine phosphorylation of Smad2/3 with subsequent recruitment of Smad4. [21][22][23][24][25][26]
[27][28][29] [18] [19] [11] [12][20] 
TGF-Œ≤1 induces apoptosis and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo through the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) High levels of VEGF and TGF-Œ≤1 are present in many tumors. Crosstalk between the signalling pathways activated by these growth factors controls endothelial cell apoptosis and angiogenesis. [1]

There are several assays for TGB-Œ≤1 measurement available.
e.g. Human TGF-Œ≤1 ELISA Kit.
The Human TGF-Œ≤ 1 ELISA (Enzyme ‚ÄìLinked Immunosorbent Assay) kit is an in vitro enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay for the quantitative measurement of human TGF-Œ≤1 in serum, plasma, cell
culture supernatants, and urine. This assay employs an antibody specific for human TGF-Œ≤1 coated on a 96-well plate. Standards and samples are pipetted into the wells and TGF-Œ≤1 present in a sample is bound to the wells by the immobilized antibody. The wells are washed and biotinylated anti-human TGF-Œ≤1 antibody is added. After washing away unbound biotinylated antibody, HRP-
conjugated streptavidin is pipetted to the  wells. The wells are again washed, a TMB substrate
solution is added to the wells and colour develops in proportion to the amount of TGF-Œ≤1 bound. The StopSolution changes the colour from blue to yellow, and the intensity of the colour is measured at 450 nm

	dcterms:description	"""Stellate cell activation means a transdifferentiation from a quiescent vitamin A‚Äìstoring cell to
a proliferative and contractile myofibroblast. 
Multiple cells and cytokines play a part in the regulation of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation that consists of discrete phenotype responses, mainly proliferation, contractility, fibrogenesis, matrix degradation, chemotaxis, and retinoid loss.
HSCs undergo activation through a two-phase process. The first step, the initiation phase, is triggered by injured hepatocytes, reactive oxygen speecies (ROS) and paracrine stimulation from neighbouring cell types (Kupffer cells  (KCs), Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and platelets) and make HSCs sensitized to activation by up-regulating various receptors. The perpetuation phase refers to the maintenance of HSC activation, which is a dynamic process including the secretion of autocrine and paracrine growth factors (such as TGF-Œ≤1), chemokines, and the up-regulation of collagen synthesis (mainly type I collagen). In response to growth factors (including Platelet-derived Growth Factor (PDGF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)) HSCs proliferate. Increased contractility (Endothelin-1 and NO are the key opposing counter-regulators that control HSC contractility, in addition to angiotensinogen II, and others) leads to increased portal resistance. Driven by chemoattractants their accumulation in areas of injury is enhanced.
TGF-Œ≤1 synthesis promotes activation of neighbouring quiescent hepatic stellate cells, whereas the release of HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) stimulates regeneration of adjacent hepatocytes. The release of chemoattractants (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1(MCP-1) and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs)) amplifies inflammation.

	dcterms:description	"""Collagen is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendons, ligaments and skin. It is also abundant in corneas, cartilage, bones, blood vessels, the gut, intervertebral discs, and the dentin in teeth. In muscle tissue, it serves as a major component of the endomysium. Collagen is the main structural protein in the extracellular space in the various connective tissues, making up from 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content. In normal tissues, collagen provides strength, integrity, and structure. When tissues are disrupted following injury, collagen is needed to repair the defect. If too much collagen is deposited, normal anatomical structure is lost, function is compromised, and fibrosis results. 
The fibroblast is the most common collagen producing cell.Collagen-producing cells may also arise from the process of transition of differentiated epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells (EMT). This has been observed e.g. during renal fibrosis (transformation of tubular epithelial cells into fibroblasts) and in liver injury (transdifferentiation of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes into fibroblasts). [1]
There are close to 20 different types of collagen found with the predominant form being type I collagen. This fibrillar form of collagen represents over 90 percent of our total collagen and is composed of three very long protein chains which are wrapped around each other to form a triple helical structure called a collagen monomer. 
Collagen is produced initially as a larger precursor molecule called procollagen.  As the procollagen is secreted from the cell, procollagen proteinases remove the extension peptides from the ends of the molecule. The processed molecule is referred to as collagen and is involved in fiber formation. In the extracellular spaces the triple helical collagen molecules line up and begin to form fibrils and then fibers. Formation of stable crosslinks within and between the molecules is promoted by the enzyme lysyl oxidase and gives the collagen fibers tremendous strength. [2] The overall amount of collagen deposited by fibroblasts is a regulated balance between collagen synthesis and collagen catabolism.
Disturbance of this balance leads to changes in the amount and composition of collagen. Changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix initiate  positive feedback pathways that increase collagen production. 
Normally, collagen in connective tissues has a slow turn over; degradating enzymes are collagenases, belonging to the family of matrix metalloproteinases  (MMPs).Other cells that can synthesize and release collagenase are macrophages, neutrophils, osteoclasts, and tumor cells.

Determination of the amount of collagen produced in vitro can be done in a variety of ways ranging from simple colorimetric assays to elaborate chromatographic procedures using radioactive and non-radioactive material. What most of these procedures have in common is the need to destroy the cell layer to obtain solubilized collagen from the pericellular matrix.
Rishikof et al describe several methods to assess the in vitro production of type I collagen: Western immunoblotting of intact alpha1(I) collagen using antibodies directed to alpha1(I) collagen amino and carboxyl propeptides, the measurement of alpha1(I) collagen mRNA levels using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and methods to determine the transcriptional regulation of alpha1(I) collagen using a nuclear run-on assay.

	dcterms:description	"""Immature epidermal dendritic cells, known as Langerhans cells, and dermal dendritic cells serve as antigen-presenting cells ([1];[2];[3];[4]). In this role, they recognize and internalize the hapten-protein complex formed during covalent binding leading to their activation. Subsequently, the dendritic cell loses its ability to seize new hapten-protein complexes and gains the potential to display the allergen-MHC-complex to naive T-cells; this process is often referred to as dendritic cell maturation. Simultaneously, under the influence of fibroblast- blood endothelial- and lymph endothelial chemokines (e.g. CCL19, CCL21) and epidermal cytokines (e.g. interleukin (IL), IL-1 Œ±, IL-1Œ≤, IL-18, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Œ±)) maturing dendritic cells migrate from the epidermis to the dermis of the skin and then to the proximal lymph nodes, where they can present the hapten-protein complex to T-cells via a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule ([5];[6]). Dendritic cell activation, upon exposure to hapten-protein complexes also leads to functional changes in the cells. For example, there are changes in chemokine secretion, cytokine secretion and in the expression of chemokine receptors (see[3]). Additionally, during dendritic cell maturation MHC, co-stimulatory and intercellular adhesion molecules (e.g. CD40, CD86, and DC11 and CD54, respectively) are up-regulated (see[3];[4];[7]).
Signal transduction cascades precede changes in expression of surface proteins markers and chemokine or cytokine secretion. 
In fact, there is evidence that during the response, hapten-protein complexes can react with cell surface proteins and activate mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway. In particular, the biochemical pathway involving extracellulare signal-regulating kinases- the c-jun N-terminal kinases and the p38 kinases have been shown to be activated upon exposure to protein-binding chemicals[8]. These pathways are of particular importance in keratinocytes and dendritic cell response to protein-hapten complexes. 
Components of signal transduction pathways are kinases, which phosphorylate and dephosphorylate a variety of substrates in order to elicit a change in the expression or secretion of target molecules. As a result, components of the signal transduction cascade are thought to be biomarkers[9]. Investigations into the possible role of calcium influx as an early event in dendritic cell activation suggest that calcium influx is a second event following reactive oxygen species induction[10];[11].
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Omic studies
Genomic and proteomic studies also have the potential to reveal biomarkers in dendritic cell-based assays. Custom designed arrays or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of selected genes have been used to highlight the reaction of dendritic cells (see[3]). 
VITOSENS, an assay that uses human CD34+ progenitor-derived dendritic cells (CD34-DC), is based on the differential expression of the cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 receptor (CCR2)[12]. 
Genomic signatures have been also developed for the identification of human sensitising chemicals: a biomarker signature, the Genomic Allergen Rapid Detection test (GARD) based on the human myelomonocytic cell line MUTZ-3[13] and a genomic platform, SENSIS, which consists of measuring the over-expression of 3 sets of genes, that may allow the in vitro assessment of the sensitising potential of a compound[14].
In Vitro Assays for Cell Surface Markers, Cytokines, and Chemokines
Alterations in intercellular adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines are part of the immunology response which can serve as biomarkers. Since dendritic cell maturation upon exposure to hapten-protein complexes is accompanied by changes in surface marker expression, these surface markers are perceived as promising candidates as primary biomarkers of dendritic cell activation for the development of cell-based in vitro assays. While a variety of surface markers have been described to be up-regulated upon dendritic cell maturation, a review of the literature reveals that CD86 expression, followed by CD54 and CD40, are the most extensively studied intercellular adhesion and co-stimulator molecules to date. 
The human Cell Line Activation Test (h-CLAT) reported flow cytometry results for CD86 and CD54 expression in THP-1 cells[15];[16]. An OECD Test Guideline for the h-CLAT is currently under review. The h-CLAT protocol can be found in the EURL ECVAM Database Service on Alternative Methods to animal experimentation (DB-ALM): Protocol No158 for human Cell Line Activation Test (h-CLAT)[17]. Other studies with THP-1 cells include that of An et al. (2009). Another assay, the myeloid U937 skin sensitisation test (U-SENS), is based as well on the measurement of CD86 by flow cytometry[18];[19];[20]).
In addition to that, a variety of cytokines have been studied in relationship to skin sensitizers[4]. IL-8 is a promising chemokine for distinguishing sensitisers from non-sensitisers. Quantification of IL-8 can be performed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay, a technique that is far simpler and amenable to high throughput screening than the flow cytometry technique used to measure CD86 expression[3]. The expression of other cytokines linked to skin sensitisers include IL-1 Œ±, IL-1Œ≤, IL-18, and TNF-Œ± form the basis for other dendritic cell assays.

	dcterms:description	"""The molecular initiating event is covalent binding of electrophilic chemical species with selected nucleophilic molecular sites of action in proteins generating immunogenic neoantigens through a process termed haptenisation[1];[2]. In contrast to receptor-mediated chemical interactions electrophiles are not specific with regard to their molecular target. Moreover, some chemicals are able to react with several different nucleophilic chemical substituents. Therefore, the identification of the specific target protein is not considered to be critical. Moreover, it is recognized that reactivity measured with a particular nucleophilic target or model nucleophile does not necessarily reflect a specific chemical reaction, as many reactions target the same chemical substituent[3].
For toxicological endpoints for which protein binding is important, the biological nucleophile is assumed to be selected amino acids. The exact extent of adduct formation to each amino acid is dependent on the relative hardness / softness of the electrophile and nucleophile[3]. The inability to identify the exact biological nucleophile is deemed less important than information regarding the electrophile. As noted in the hard-soft acid base theory, a soft electrophile will have a relative preference for a soft nucleophile; while a hard electrophile will have a relative preference for a hard nucleophile. As a consequence, for a series of electrophiles assigned to the same mechanistic cluster within a particular domain, the relative rates of reactivity between each electrophile and any nucleophile will remain the same. In other words, while absolute reactivity may vary with protocols, relative reactivity will usually not vary significantly[3].
Binding experiments with small model nucleophiles reveal that, within a particular reaction within a mechanism, the rate of reactivity varies markedly. Moreover, while some compounds appear to bind exclusively with thiol or amine, others bind to a variety of nucleophiles. However, an electrophile is most likely to exhibit a preference for a particular nucleophile. 
In more complex systems, nucleophilic target preferences may be masked by other factors. It is self-evident that the number of cysteine and lysine residues within a protein will impact target probability. For example, for serum albumin, a major serum protein, 10% of the amino acid residues are lysine but albumin has very few free cysteine residues. Also, it is self-evident that a target site (e.g. cysteine or lysine) which is located on an exposed surface of a protein is more likely to react with an electrophile than one that is located within a grove or fold of a protein. Such steric constraints are imposed by the primary structure (i.e. amino acid sequence) of the peptide or protein, as well as the secondary and tertiary structure of proteins imposed by disulfide bridges, and folding and coiling. Similarly, the microenvironment of the reaction site (e.g. hydrophilic versus hydrophobic) may affect the probability of a particular reaction. Free cysteine residues are more abundant in proteins in the aqueous cytosol than in the non- aqueous biomembranes [4]. 
An ancillary event in identifying protein-binding is metabolism and/or abiotic transformation (e.g. autoxidation)[5].

In silico models, including physiological-based pharmacokinetic models and traditional structure activity ones, as well as in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches exist.
In silico Methods
It is generally recognized that reaction-based methods, as opposed to other means of defining chemical similarity, allow for easier interpretation and provide greater confidence in their use[6]. Chemical reactions related to covalent protein binding have recently been reviewed[7];[8];[9]. Measurements and estimations of reactivity have also recently been reviewed[1];[3]. Computational or in silico techniques to predict chemical reactivity have been developed; they vary in complexity from the relatively simple approach of forming chemical categories from 2D structural alerts (i.e. SARs for qualitative identification of chemical sub-structures with the potential of being reactive), such as used in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)QSAR Toolbox[10] to QSAR models (i.e. quantitative prediction of relative reactivity) as described by Schw√∂bel et al.[11].
In Chemico Protocols and Databases
While methionine, histidine, and serine all possess nucleophilic groups that are found in skin proteins, the ‚ÄìSH group of cysteine and the Œµ-NH2 group of lysine are the most often studied. Soft electrophilic interactions involving the thiol group can be modelled with small molecules. 
Glutathione (GSH; L-Œ≥-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-glycine) is the most widely used model nucleophile in soft electrophilic reactivity assays. Typically, chemicals are incubated with GHS and, after a defined reaction time, the concentration of free thiol groups is measured. Such depletion based assays assume adduct formation, which is typically not confirmed. Good relationships between GSH reactivity and toxicity have been demonstrated. Examples of this method can be found in the literature[3];[12];[13];[14]. Recently, OECD adopted the new Test Guideline (TG) No442C: In chemico skin sensitisation ‚Äì Direct Peptide Reactivity Assay (DPRA). This method quantifies the reactivity of chemicals towards model synthetic peptides containing either lysine or cysteine[15].  The DPRA protocol can be found in the EURL ECVAM Database Service on Alternative Methods to animal experimentation (DB-ALM): Protocol No154 for Direct Peptide Reactivity Assay (DPRA) for skin sensitisation testing[16].
The importance of reaction chemistry for sensitisation indicates that identification of the reaction limited chemical spaces is critical for using the proposed AOP. Systematic databases for reaction-specific chemical spaces are being developed. For example, in chemico databases reporting measurements of reactive potency currently exist for Michael acceptors ([14];[17];[18]). The use of model nucleophiles containing primary amino (‚ÄìNH2) groups, such as in the amino acids lysine are less well-documented, with the principle of measuring relative reactivity being the same as for thiol[1].

	dcterms:description	"""Skin sensitisation is an immunological process that is described in two phases: the induction of sensitisation and the subsequent elicitation of the immune reaction. A sensitised subject has the capacity to mount a more accelerated secondary response to the same chemical. Upon reaching an unknown threshold number of hapten-specific T cells an individual will be said to be sensitised and will elicit a T cell-mediated eczematous skin reaction (termed allergic contact dermatitis, ACD) at the site of sensitiser re-exposure. Above the threshold, the severity of the adverse effect is assumed to increase proportionally to the dose, so the total dose per area of skin (e.g. Œºg/cm2) is the critical exposure determinant. In this regard, animal data is consistent with human clinical data[1].       
The allergic reaction causes inflammation of the skin manifested by varying degrees of erythema, oedema, and vesiculation. It takes up to one week or more for individuals to develop specific sensitivity to a new allergen following exposure. An individual who never has been sensitised to a substance may develop only a mild dermatitis 2 weeks following the initial exposure but typically develops severe dermatitis within 1-2 days of the second and subsequent exposures[2].

[3]Human sensitisation testing is conducted with the Human Repeat Insult Patch Test (HRIPT), as described by McNamee et al.[4];[5].   
Skin biopsy may help to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other disorders.
Animal models have been developed to assess the sensitisation potential of chemicals. Adler et al. (2011) have reviewed animal test methods for skin sensitisation[6]. Briefly, among these in vivo assays are the guinea-pig occluded patch test[7];[8], the Magnusson-Kligman guinea pig maximization test[7];[9];[10], and the murine Local Lymph Node Assay[11];[12];[13]. Using LLNA data, sensitisers can be grouped into potency groups (e.g. extreme, strong, moderate, weak and non-sensitisers). However, as noted by Basketter et al. [14], the LLNA is not without limitations.

	dcterms:description	"""Keratinocytes are the major cell type of the epidermis of the skin. They are known to be the primary site of skin metabolism and play an important role in epithelial Dendritic Cells (DC) activation. 
Uptake of the hapten-protein complex formed during covalent binding by keratinocytes activates multiple events, including the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-18) and the induction of cyto-protective cellular pathways. Hapten-protein complexes can activate the inflammasome ([1];[2]) and in so doing induce IL-18 production. Activation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-18 results from cleavage of inactive IL-18 precursor protein by inflammasome-associated caspase-1[3]. Intracellular Nod-like receptors (NLR) contain sensors for a number of cellular insults. Upon activation, NLRs oligomerise form molecular complexes (i.e. inflammasomes) that are involved in the activation of inflammatory-associated caspases, including caspase-1. Induction of intracellular levels of IL-18 exhibit responses upon exposure to hapten-protein complexes which can be used to establish potency[4]. Keratinocyte exposure to allergens also results in induction of antioxidant/electrophile response element ARE/EpRE-dependent pathways[5]. Briefly, reactive chemicals bind to Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associates protein 1) that normally inhibit the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Released Nrf2 interacts with other nuclear proteins and binds to and activates ARE/EpREdependent pathways, including the cytoprotective genes NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferase (GSHST), among others ([5];[6]).

Methods that have been previously reviewed and approved by a recognized authority should be included in the Overview section above.
All other methods, including those well established in the published literature, should be described here. 
Consider the following criteria when describing each method:
1. Is the assay fit for purpose?
2. Is the assay directly or indirectly (i.e. a surrogate) related to a key event relevant to the final
adverse effect in question?
3. Is the assay repeatable?
4. Is the assay reproducible?

Investigations have focused on the DNA antioxidant-response elements (ARE), also known as electrophile response element. 
OECD TG 442D is the validated test guideline for measuring the activation of the antioxidant/electrophile response element (ARE) - dependant pathway[7]). Currently, the only in vitro ARE-Nrf2 luciferase test method covered by this Test Guideline is the KeratinoSensTM. This assay uses a luciferase reporter gene under control of a single copy of the ARE element of the human AKR1C2 gene stably inserted into immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells)[8]. The KeratinoSensTM protocol can be found in the EURL ECVAM Database Service on Alternative Methods to animal experimentation (DB-ALM): Protocol No155 for KeratinoSensTM[9].
The Keap1/Nrf2/ARE/EpRE cell signalling assay is also the mechanistic basis for the work on skin sensitisation chemicals at CeeTox Inc.[10]. This work includes quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction measurements of the relative abundance of mRNA for eleven selected genes whose expression is controlled by one of the three following pathways: Keap1/Nrf 2/ARE/EpRE, ARNT/AhR/XRE, and Nrf1/MTF/MRE. Interestingly, both Emter et al.[8] and McKim et al.[10] combine their cell signalling results with chemical reactivity data in algorithms, which can be viewed as a first step in using the AOP in quantitative assessment.
In vitro assays based on IL-18 induction in human keratinocytes (cell line NCTC 2544)[11] or IL-8 induction in THP-1 cells[12] have also been developed to identify allergens. Other studies have described chemokines (e.g. CCL2, CCL4) and receptor (e.g. CCR7) (see[13]).

Insight into sustained AHR activation is provided by examining the induction of ethoxyresorufin-O,O-deethylase in liver by three DLCs at three different time points (NTP, 2006a; NTP, 2006b; NTP, 2006c). Plots of the fractional or normalized ethoxyresorufin-O,O- deethylase response from three NTP cancer bioassays are shown in the plots on the left of Fig. 2. Induction of ethoxyresorufin-O,O- deethylase is easily measured and serves as a biomarker of CYP1A1 gene expression. The dose term on the x-axis is the area under the curve (AUC) of liver concentration. The normalized ethoxyresorufin-O,O-deethylase response on the y-axis is similar at 14, 31 and 53 weeks (Left column of Fig. 2). The plots for 31 weeks and 53 weeks are shifted to the right given the dose term on the x-axis is the AUC of hepatic concentration of the three chemicals, TCDD, 4-PeCDF and PCB-126. To obtain a measure of sustained AHR activation, the fractional ethoxyresorufin-O,O- deethylase response is multiplied by the number of weeks. Hence, a fractional response of 50% at 14 weeks would be a sustained AHR activation index of 7. The sustained AHR activation index is plotted versus the AUC of hepatic toxic equivalents (TEQ) for all three chemicals calculated using TEF values of 1.0, 0.3 and 0.1 for TCDD, 4-PeCDF and PCB-126 respectively (Van den Berg et al., 2006) (Fig. 2, right column). The sustained AHR activation index shows a strong relationship to the AUC of hepatic TEQ and thus the sustained AHR activation index reflects the dose, potency and duration of DLCs in the liver.

Dose-response modeling can be performed using the sustained AHR activation index as the dose term and the measures of the various KEs or biomarkers as the response. Fig. 4 shows an example in which the well-known Hill dose-response model was used. One of the model parameters is the ED50 or EC50 value e in other words, the effective dose or concentration sufficient to produce a 50% of the maximal response. This parameter is also called the half- maximal dose. When this measure of sustained AHR activation is used, the ESA50 denotes the level of sustained AHR activation required for a half-maximal response.

Figure 2: Dose-response of CYP1A1 activation measured by EROD as a measure of AHR activation in response to an AUC measure of dose. The AUC is the hepatic concentration multiplied by the time in weeks. The left hand plots show measured EROD from the NTP bioassays in response to chronic dosing of TCDD (top), 4-PeCDF (middle) or PCB-126 (bottom) (NTP, 2006a, 2006b, 2006c). Dose-dependent EROD levels are sustained over time. The right hand plots show the EROD response on normalized to a zero-to-one scale as a measure of AHR activation level.



shows plots of the increase in 7-Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) versus the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of the hepatic concentration of three dioxin-like chemicals, TCDD, 4-PeCDF and PCB-126 occurring during lifetime dosing. The figure shows corresponding plots of normalized EROD as a measure of AHR activation. In all three cases, the shape of the dose-response remained consistent except that the position along the dose axis increased with increasing time for all three chemicals. This observation indicates that the level of AHR activation remains relatively constant over time with a continuing dose of persistent AHR ligand. A measure of sustained activation (SA) of the AHR can be calculated by multiplying the level of AHR activation observed as fractional CYP1A1 induction by the number of weeks of dosing. SA calculated in this way can be used as a dose surrogate. In order to use the measurements of all three DLCs considered here, their hepatic AUC concentrations were multiplied by their toxic equivalence factors (TEFs) (Van den Berg et al., 2006). SA was plotted against the AUC of hepatic TEQ concentration (Figure 3).






Figure 3: Sustained AHR activation versus the area-under-the-curve of hepatic TEQ. TEQ was calculated for TCDD, PeCDF and PCB126 using TEF values of 1, 0.3 and 0.1 respectively. Data from all three chemicals at 14 weeks are shown with blue markers, those from 31 weeks with green markers and those from 53 weeks with orange markers. Please see narrative for additional details.



The plot shows a consistent pattern that can be fit with a Hill function. The curve is shallower than a first-order Hill plot shown by the Hill coefficient less than one. This shallowness may be due to differences in potency and efficacy at different times, possibly stemming from hepatic sequestration of ligand by CYP1A2, especially for PeCDF, thus decreasing the effective hepatic concentration relative to the measured concentration.

Indirectly, the inhibition of apoptosis in either damaged or initiated cells favors their survival, and inhibition of apoptosis af- fords initiated cells an increased opportunity for clonal expansion and autonomous growth with the chance to acquire additional mutations during the process of tumor progression. AHR activation inhibits apoptosis in altered hepatic foci (i.e., initiated hepatic cells), and this inhibition affords cells within altered hepatic foci a sur- vival advantage and increases the likelihood that these cells will acquire additional mutations.
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""For this KE, initiation-promotion studies provide indirect evidence of inhibition of intrafocal apoptosis due to sustained AHR activation and direct evidence of a threshold for the clonal expansion of altered hepatic foci (Dragan and Schrenk, 2000; Teeguarden et al., 1999). Although increases of cell proliferation could contribute to the increase in size and volume fraction of altered hepatic foci, the greater magnitude of inhibition of apoptosis suggests it is the primary factor contributing to clonal expansion of altered hepatic foci, at least early on (Luebeck et al., 2000; Moolgavkar et al., 1996; Stinchcombe et al., 1995). AHR activators inhibit apoptosis produced by UV light exposure of human cell lines and rat primary hepatocytes (Ambolet-Camoit et al., 2010; Chopra et al., 2009, 2010; Schwarz et al., 2000). Inhibition of apoptosis in primary rat hepatocytes was mediated through phosphorylation and inactivation of p53 and modulation of Mdm2, Tfgb1/4, and AGR2; in addition, inhi- bition of apoptosis required protein synthesis (Ambolet-Camoit et al., 2010; Chopra and Schrenk, 2011; Chopra et al., 2009, 2010; Davis et al., 2001; Franc et al., 2008; Paajarvi et al., 2005; Worner and Schrenk, 1996, 1998). Cytotoxicity appears to occur after intrafocal apoptosis inhibition is measured and inflammation-driven cell proliferation is a somewhat later event. What remains unknown is whether a proliferative response in stem and stellate cells occurs earlier or at the same time as intrafocal apoptosis inhibition.
Quantitative stereology is used to quantify the growth of AHF and such studies provide a measure of this KE (Hendrich et al., 1987; Dragan et al., 1997; Teeguarden et al., 1999; Viluksela et al., 2000).

	dcterms:description	"""Over the time period of high levels of sustained AHR activation, DLCs produce a complex pattern of cell proliferative responses. Teeguarden et al. (1999) observed that rats initiated with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and then dosed with either 0.1 or 1 ng/ kg-d TCDD for one month exhibited a reduced labeling index relative to controls, and reduced BrdU-labeling was also observed following the 0.1 ng/kg-d TCDD dose after three months. Maronpot et al. (1993) observed a reduction in BrdU labeling index in hepatocytes at a low dose of 3.5 ng/kg-d TCDD in DEN-initiated rats after 30 weeks of TCDD administration but, at a dose of 125 ng/kg/d the labeling index was increased.
Both parenchymal calls and liver stem cells are likely involved in the organ-level response to sustained AHR activation. Early acti- vation of the AHR in zone 3 of the liver acinus causes decreased hepatocyte replication and may act as an indirect proliferative stimulus for stem cells and hepatoblasts (Andersen et al., 1997; Conolly and Andersen, 1997; Tritscher et al., 1992). Oval cells in the periportal region likely function as a source of replacement of hepatocytes after inhibition of normal hepatocyte replication- replacement (Paku et al., 2001; Sahin et al., 2008; Tanaka et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2003). While hepatocyte replication is considered the normal means for replacement of liver parenchyma, inhibition of hepatocyte replication in centrilobular regions induced by TCDD may induce normally quiescent liver stem cells to proliferate.
Following longer period of sustained AHR activation, organ- level increases in cell proliferation ensue, demonstrated by an in- crease in BrdU labeling and likely reflecting the regenerative response to organ-wide toxicity (Hailey et al., 2005).
Non-parenchymal cells, including stem cells, hepatoblasts, biliary cells, stellate cells, endothelial cells, and Kuppfer cells, play a role in this AOP. In rodents, TCDD elicits a fibrogenic and bile duct proliferative response that requires pathological alteration of stellate cell function and increased differentiation and growth of hepatoblasts and bile duct cells before 33 weeks of exposure. Retinoid depletion induces stellate cell proliferation, production of extracellular matrix components, and the transition to fibroblast; stellate cells maintain vitamin A homeostasis and respond to liver injury with formation of proliferative cytokines such as TGF-a and EGF (Friedman, 2008; Pintilie et al., 2010; Senoo et al., 2010). TCDD induces loss of retinoid content (presumably from stellate cells) and may disrupt the extensive communication between various liver cell types (Fletcher et al., 2001; Hoegberg et al., 2005; Pierre et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2003). Thus, TCDD-induced retinol loss from hepatic stellate cells may contribute to cell proliferation, biliary fibrosis, and cholangiolarcarcinoma (Fattore et al., 2000; Friedman, 2008; Hakansson and Hanberg, 1989; Schmidt et al., 2003).
AHR activation also induces changes in stem/oval cells. All of the rats receiving 100 ng/kg/day TCDD, the highest dose group animals in the 2-year cancer bioassay, developed oval cell hyperplasia with clear statistical increases in this endpoint at 22 ng/kg/day or greater (Hailey et al., 2005).
Evidence points to the involvement of TNF-alpha regulation in the proliferative response of hepatic stem cells; this is likely mediated through modulation of the levels of TNF-alpha, altered beta-catenin signaling, and inhibition of cell-to-cell contact (Knight et al., 2000; Umannova et al., 2007; Vondracek et al., 2009; Dietrich et al., 2002; Prochazkova et al.,2011; Weiss et al., 2008). TNF-alpha is an inflammatory cytokine with an important role in liver tumor promotion. More research on how sustained AHR activation dysregulates normal TNF-alpha activity could be very impactful on evolving the AOP.

	dcterms:description	"""Thyroperoxidase (TPO) is a heme-containing apical membrane protein within the follicular lumen of thyrocytes that acts as the enzymatic catalyst for thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis. TPO catalyzes several reactions in the thyroid gland, including: the oxidation of iodide; nonspecific iodination of tyrosyl residues of thyroglobulin (Tg); and, the coupling of iodotyrosyls to produce Tg-bound monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT) (Divi et al., 1997; Kessler et al., 2008; Ruf et al., 2006; Taurog et al., 1996). The outcome of TPO inhibition is decreased synthesis of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), a decrease in release of these hormones from the gland into circulation, and unless compensated, a consequent decrease in systemic concentrations of T4, and possibly T3. The primary product of TPO-catalyzed TH synthesis is T4 (Taurog et al., 1996; Zoeller et al., 2007) that would be peripherally or centrally deiodinated to T3.

It is important to note that TPO is a complex enzyme and that has two catalytic cycles and is capable of iodinating multiple species (Divi et al., 1997). Alterations in all of these events are not covered by some of the commonly used assays that measure &ldquo;TPO inhibition&rdquo; (e.g., guicacol and AmplexUltraRed, see below).&nbsp; Therefore, in the context of this AOP we are using TPO inhibiton not in the classical sense, but instead to refer to the empirical data derived from the assays commonly used assays to investigate environmental chemicals.

Figure 1 below illustrates the synthesis fo thyroxine by thyroperoxidase showing the iodination of tyrosyl residues and subsequent coupling of iodotyrosyls to form T4.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Inhibition of TPO can be reversible, with transient interaction between the enzyme and the chemical, or irreversible, whereby suicide substrates permanently inactivate the enzyme. Reversible and irreversible TPO inhibition may be determined by the chemical structure, may be concentration dependent, or may be influenced by other conditions, including the availability of iodine (Doerge and Chang, 2002).

The ontogeny of TPO has been determined using both direct and indirect evidence.&nbsp; Available evidence suggests the 11th to 12th fetal week as the beginning of functional TPO in humans. In rodents, TPO function begins late in the second fetal week, with the first evidence of T4 secretion on gestational day 17 (Remy et al., 1980). Thyroid-specific genes appear in the thyroid gland according to a specific temporal pattern; thyroglobulin (Tg), TPO (Tpo), and TSH receptor (Tshr) genes are expressed by gestational day 14 in rats, and the sodium iodide symporter, NIS (Nis), is expressed by gestational day 16 in rats. Maturation to adult function is thought to occur within a few weeks after parturition in rats and mice, and within the first few months in neonatal humans (Santisteban and Bernal, 2005).&nbsp; Tg is first detected in human fetuses starting at 5th week of gestation and rises throughout gestation (Thorpe-Beeston et al., 1992), but iodine trapping and T4 production does not occur until around 10-12 weeks.&nbsp; Also, the dimerization of Tg, a characteristic of adult TH storage, is not found until much later in human gestation (Pintar, 2000). In rats, Tg immunoreactivity does not appear until day 15 of gestation (Fukiishi et al., 1982; Brown et al., 2000). The vast majority of research and knowledge on Tg is from mammals, although genomic orthologs are known for a variety of other species (Holzer et al., 2016).&nbsp; It is noted that prior to the onset of fetal thyroid function, TH are still required, the fetus relying solely on maternal sources. Chemical-induced TPO inhibition can affect synthesis in the maternal gland and in the fetal gland.
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""There are no approved OECD or EPA guideline study protocols for measurement of TPO inhibition.. However, there is an OECD scoping document on identification of chemicals that modulate TH signaling that provides details on a TPO assay (OECD, 2017).&nbsp;

From the early 1960&#39;s, microsomal fractions prepared from porcine thyroid glands and isolated porcine follicles were used as a source of TPO for inhibition experiments (Taurog, 2005). Limited information has been published using microsomes from human goiter samples (Vickers et al., 2012) and rat thyroid glands (Paul et al., 2013; 2014; Paul-Friedman et al., 2016).

TPO activity has been measured for decades via indirect assessment by kinetic measurement of the oxidation of guaiacol (Chang &amp; Doerge 2000; Hornung et al., 2010; Schmutzler et al., 2007). &nbsp;This method is a low-throughput assay due to the very rapid kinetics of the guaiacol oxidation reaction. More recently, higher-throughput methods using commercial fluorescent and luminescent substrates with rodent, porcine, and human microsomal TPO have been developed (Vickers et al., 2012; Paul et al., 2013; 2014; Kaczur et al., 1997). This assay substitutes a pre-fluorescent substrate (Amplex UltraRed) for guaiacol, that when incubated with a source of peroxidase and excess hydrogen peroxidase, results in a stable fluorescent product proportional to TPO activity (Vickers et al., 2012).&nbsp; The stability of the fluorescent reaction product allows this assay to be used in a higher throughput format (Paul-Friedman et al., 2016). This approach is appropriate for high-throughput screening, but does not elucidate the specific mechanism by which a chemical may inhibit TPO (Paul-Friedman et al., 2016), and as with most in vitro assays, is subject to various sources of assay interference (Thorne et al., 2010).

HPLC has been used to measure of the activity of TPO via formation of the precursors monoiodotyrosine (MIT), diiodotyrosine (DIT), and both T3 and T4, in a reaction mixture containing TPO, or a surrogate enzyme such as lactoperoxidase (Divi &amp; Doerge 1994). The tools and reagents for this method are all available. However, HPLC or other analytical chemistry techniques make this a low throughput assay, depending on the level of automation. A primary advantage of this in vitro method is that it directly informs hypotheses regarding the specific mechanism by which a chemical may impact thyroid hormone synthesis in vitro. &nbsp;

	dcterms:description	"""The thyroid hormones (TH), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are thyrosine based hormones. Synthesis of TH is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) binding to its receptor and thyroidal availability of iodine via the sodium iodide symporter (NIS). Other proteins contributing to TH production in the thyroid gland, including thyroperoxidase (TPO), dual oxidase enzymes (DUOX), and pendrin are also necessary for iodothyronine production (Zoeller et al., 2007).

The production of THs in the thyroid gland and resulting serum concentrations are controlled by a negatively regulated feedback mechanism.&nbsp; Decreased T4 and T3 serum concentrations activates the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis which upregulates thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) that acts to increase production of additional THs (Zoeller and Tan, 2007). This regulatory system includes: 1) the hypothalamic secretion of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH); 2) the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion from the anterior pituitary; 3) hormonal transport by the plasma binding proteins; 4) cellular uptake mechanisms at the tissue level; 5) intracellular control of TH concentration by deiodinating mechanisms; 6) transcriptional function of the nuclear TH receptor; and 7) in the fetus, the transplacental passage of T4 and T3 (Zoeller et al., 2007).

TRH and the TSH primarily regulate the production of T4, often considered a &ldquo;pro-hormone,&rdquo; and to a lesser extent of T3, the transcriptionally active TH. Most of the hormone released from the thyroid gland into circulation is in the form of T4, while peripheral deiodination of T4 is responsible for the majority of circulating T3. Outer ring deiodination of T4 to T3 is catalyzed by the deiodinases 1 and 2 (DIO1 and DIO2), with DIO1 expressed mainly in liver and kidney, and DIO2 expressed in several tissues including the brain (Bianco et al., 2006). Conversion of T4 to T3 takes place mainly in liver and kidney, but also in other target organs such as in the brain, the anterior pituitary, brown adipose tissue, thyroid and skeletal muscle (Gereben et al., 2008; Larsen, 2009).&nbsp;

Most evidence for the ontogeny of TH synthesis comes from measurements of serum hormone concentrations.&nbsp; And, importantly, the impact of xenobiotics on fetal hormones must include the influence of the maternal compartment since a majority of fetal THs are derived from maternal blood&nbsp;early in fetal life, with a transition during mid-late gestation to fetal production of THs that is still supplemented by maternal THs.&nbsp;In humans, THs can be found in the fetus as early as gestational weeks 10-12, and concentations rise continuously until birth. At term, fetal T4 is similar to maternal levels, but T3 remains 2-3 fold lower than maternal levels.&nbsp; In rats, THs can be detected in the fetus as early as the second gestational week, but fetal synthesis does not start until gestational day 17 with birth at gestational day 22-23. Maternal THs continue to supplement fetal production until parturition. (see Howdeshell, 2002; Santisteban and Bernal, 2005 for review).&nbsp;The ontogeny of TPO inhibition during development by environmental chemicals is a data gap.

Decreased TH synthesis in the thyroid gland may result from several possible molecular-initiating events (MIEs) including: 1) Disruption of key catalytic enzymes or cofactors needed for TH synthesis, including TPO, NIS, or dietary iodine insufficiency. Theoretically, decreased synthesis of Tg could also affect TH production (Kessler et al., 2008; Yi et al., 1997). Mutations in genes that encode requisite proteins in the thyroid may also lead to impaired TH synthesis, including mutations in pendrin associated with Pendred Syndrome (Dossena et al., 2011), mutations in TPO and Tg (Huang and Jap 2015), and mutations in NIS (Spitzweg and Morris, 2010). 2) Decreased TH synthesis in cases of clinical hypothyroidism may be due to Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis or other forms of thyroiditis, or physical destruction of the thyroid gland as in radioablation or surgical treatment of thyroid lymphoma. 3) It is possible that TH synthesis may also be reduced subsequent to disruption of the negative feedback mechanism governing TH homeostasis, e.g. pituitary gland dysfunction may result in a decreased TSH signal with concomitant T3 and T4 decreases. 4) More rarely, hypothalamic dysfunction can result in decreased TH synthesis.&nbsp; Increased fetal thyroid levels are also possible.&nbsp;Maternal Graves disease results in fetal thyrotoxicosis (hyperthyroidism and increased serum T4 levels), has been successfully treated by maternal administration of TPO inhibitors (c.f., Sato et al., 2014). &nbsp;

It should be noted that different species and different lifestages store different amounts of TH precursor and iodine within the thyroid gland. Thus, decreased TH synthesis via transient iodine insufficiency or inhibition of TPO may not affect TH release from the thyroid gland until depletion of stored iodinated Tg. Adult humans may store sufficient Tg-DIT residues to serve for several months to a year of TH demand (Greer et al., 2002). Neonates and infants have a much more limited supply of less than a week.
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Decreased TH synthesis is often implied by measurement of TPO and NIS inhibition measured clinically and in laboratory models as these enzymes are essential for TH synthesis. Rarely is decreased TH synthesis measured directly, but rather the impact of chemicals on the quantity of T4 produced in the thyroid gland, or the amount of T4 present in serum is used as a marker of decreased T4 release from the thyroid gland (e.g., Romaldini et al., 1988). Methods used to assess TH synthesis include, incorporation of radiolabel tracer compounds, radioimmunoassay, ELISA, and analytical detection. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Recently, amphibian thyroid explant cultures have been used to demonstrate direct effects of chemicals on TH synthesis, as this model contains all necessary synthesis enzymes including TPO and NIS (Hornung et al., 2010). For this work THs was measured by HPLC/ICP-mass spectometry. Decreased TH synthesis and release, using T4 release as the endpoint, has been shown for thiouracil antihyperthyroidism drugs including MMI, PTU, and the NIS inhibitor perchlorate (Hornung et al., 2010).

	dcterms:description	"""Learning and memory depend upon the coordinated action of different brain regions and neurotransmitter systems constituting functionally integrated neural networks (D&rsquo;Hooge and DeDeyn, 2001). Among the many brain areas engaged in the acquisition of, or retrieval of, a learned event, the hippocampal-based memory systems have received the most study. The main learning areas and pathways are similar in rodents and primates, including man (Eichenbaum, 2000; Stanton and Spear, 1990; Squire, 2004).

In humans, the hippocampus is involved in recollection of an event&rsquo;s rich spatial-temporal contexts and distinguished from simple semantic memory which is memory of a list of facts (Burgess et al., 2000). Hemispheric specialization has occurred in humans, with the left hippocampus specializing in verbal and narrative memories (i.e., context-dependent episodic or autobiographical memory) and the right hippocampus, more prominently engaged in visuo-spatial memory (i.e., memory for locations within an environment). The hippocampus is particularly critical for the formation of episodic memory, and autobiographical memory tasks have been developed to specifically probe these functions (Eichenbaun, 2000; Willoughby et al., 2014). In rodents, there is obviously no verbal component in hippocampal memory, but reliance on the hippocampus for spatial, temporal and contextual memory function has been well documented. Spatial memory deficits and fear-based context learning paradigms engage the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex (Eichenbaum, 2000; Shors et al., 2001; Samuels et al., 2011; Vorhees and Williams, 2014; D&rsquo;Hooge and DeDeyn, 2001; Lynch, 2004; O&rsquo;Keefe and Nadal, 1978). These tasks are impaired in animals with hippocampal dysfunction (O&rsquo;Keefe and Nadal, 1978; Morris and Frey, 1987; Gilbert et al., 2016).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""In rodents, a variety of tests of learning and memory have been used to probe the integrity of hippocampal function. These include tests of spatial learning like the radial arm maze (RAM), the Barnes maze, and most commonly, the Morris water maze (MWM). Test of novelty such as novel object recognition, and fear based context learning are also sensitive to hippocampal disruption. Finally, trace fear conditioning which incorporates a temporal component upon traditional amygdala-based fear learning engages the hippocampus. A brief description of these tasks follows.

1) RAM, Barnes, MWM are examples of spatial tasks in which animals are required to learn: the location of a food reward (RAM); an escape hole to enter a preferred dark tunnel from a brightly lit open field area (Barnes maze); or a hidden platform submerged below the surface of the water in a large tank of water (MWM) (Vorhees and Williams, 2014).

2) Novel Object recognition. This is a simpler task that can be used to probe recognition memory. Two objects are presented to animal in an open field on trial 1, and these are explored. On trial 2, one object is replaced with a novel object and time spent interacting with the novel object is taken evidence of memory retention (i.e., I have seen one of these objects before, but not this one. Cohen and Stackman, 2015).

3) Contextual Fear conditioning is a hippocampal based learning task in which animals are placed in a novel environment and allowed to explore for several minutes before delivery of an aversive stimulus, typically a mild foot shock. Upon reintroduction to this same environment in the future (typically 24-48 hours after original training), animals will limit their exploration, the context of this chamber being associated with an aversive event. The degree of suppression of activity after training is taken as evidence of retention, i.e., memory (Curzon et al., 2009).

4) Trace fear conditioning. Standard fear conditioning paradigms require animals to make an association between a neutral conditioning stimulus (CS, a light or a tone) and an aversive stimulus (US, a footshock). The unconditioned response (CR) that is elicited upon delivery of the footshock US is freezing behavior. With repetition of CS/US delivery, the previously neutral stimulus comes to elicit the freezing response. This type of learning is dependent on the amygdala, a brain region associated with, but distinct from the hippocampus. Introducing a brief delay between presentation of the neutral CS and the aversive US, a trace period, requires the engagement of the amygdala and the hippocampus (Shors et al., 2004).

Most methods are well established in the published literature and many have been engaged to evaluate the effects of developmental thyroid disruption. The US EPA and OECD Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) Guidelines (OCSPP 870.6300 or OECD 426) both require testing of learning and memory (USEPA, 1998; OECD, 2007). These DNT Guidelines have been deemed valid to identify developmental neurotoxicity and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (Makris et al., 2009).

A variety of standardized learning and memory tests have been developed for human neuropsychological testing. These include episodic autobiographical memory, word pair recognition memory; object location recognition memory. Some components of these tests have been incorporated in general tests of adult intelligence (IQ) such as the WAIS and the Wechsler. Modifications have been made and norms developed for incorporating of tests of learning and memory in children. Examples of some of these tests include:

1) Rey Osterieth Complex Figure (RCFT) which probes a variety of functions including as visuospatial abilities, memory, attention, planning, and working memory (Shin et al., 2006).

2) Children&rsquo;s Auditory Verbal Learning Test (CAVLT) is a free recall of presented word lists that yields measures of Immediate Memory Span, Level of Learning, Immediate Recall, Delayed Recall, Recognition Accuracy, and Total Intrusions. (Lezak 1995; Talley, 1986).&nbsp;

3) Continuous Visual Memory Test (CVMT) measures visual learning and memory. It is a free recall of presented pictures/objects rather than words but that yields similar measures of Immediate Memory Span, Level of Learning, Immediate Recall, Delayed Recall, Recognition Accuracy, and Total Intrusions. (Lezak, 1984; 1994).

4) Story Recall from Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) Logical Memory Test Battery, a standardized neurospychological test designed to measure memory functions (Lezak, 1994; Talley, 1986).

5) Autobiographical memory (AM) is the recollection of specific personal events in a multifaceted higher order cognitive process. It includes episodic memory- remembering of past events specific in time and place, in contrast to semantic autobiographical memory is the recollection of personal facts, traits, and general knowledge. Episodic AM is associated with greater activation of the hippocampus and a later and more gradual developmental trajectory. Absence of episodic memory in early life (infantile amnesia) is thought to reflect immature hippocampal function (Herold et al., 2015; Fivush, 2015).

6) Staged Autobiographical Memory Task. In this version of the AM test, children participate in a staged event involving a tour of the hospital, perform a series of tasks (counting footprints in the hall, identifying objects in wall display, buy lunch, watched a video). It is designed to contain unique event happenings, place, time, visual/sensory/perceptual details. Four to five months later, interviews are conducted using Children&rsquo;s Autobiographical Interview and scored according to standardized scheme (Willoughby et al., 2014).

	dcterms:description	"""The VEGF-VEGFR system is an important molecular regulator of various processes linked to physiological and pathological blood vessel development, from early embryonic to adult stages. The central players in this system among vertebrate species are three vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3) and five VEGF family members that bind and activate these various receptors during vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and lymphogenesis [Shibuya, 2013]. A search of the PubMed literature for these Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms returned 41,371 entries 1989-2014 (December 4, 2014); 4982 of those entries had broad focus on ‚Äòvascular‚Äô and ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô headings. 
Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), in particular the VEGF165 splice variant, plays a key role in the regulation of angiogenesis during early embryogenesis. This is evidenced by immature blood vessel formation and embryonic lethality in mutant mouse embryos heterozygous for the Vegfa-null allele [Ferrara et al. 1996; Carmellet et al. 1996]. VEGF-A is a soluble protein that acts directly on endothelial cells through two receptor tyrosine kinases: VEGFR1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR2 (KDR). The former is a decoy receptor that traps VEGF-A into corridors preventing interaction with the active receptor, VEGFR2. When liganded, VEGFR2 induces endothelial tip cell proliferation, survival, and vascular permeability. The specific aspect of the MIE considered here would involve factors leading to a change in VEGF-A gradients. This could include a change in the local production of VEGF-A, an increase in the decoy receptor (VEGFR1), or a drop in the expression or activity of VEGFR2. Chemical effects may commence at VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) by influencing local VEGF-A ligand production, ligand binding, receptor tyrosine kinase activity, or crosstalk with angiogenic chemokines, cytokines and growth factors. VEGF-A is locally produced in the vicinity of target endothelial cells. Hypoxia (and chemical hypoxia) increases VEGF-A production through the HIF-alpha transcription pathway. VEGF-A can be trapped in the extracellular milieu by binding to components in the extracellular matrix (ECM) or VEGFR1. Since VEGFR1 binds VEGF-A with 10-fold greater affinity than does VEGFR2, VEGF-A is liberated by ECM breakdown during morphogenetic remodeling of tissues or matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production during chemical injury. These events can positively or negatively regulate the local bioavailability of VEGF-A to its cognate receptor.
Targeted disruption of VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 is early embryonic lethal; however, the vascular phenotypes differ in either case. VEGFR1-mutant (Flt1-null) embryos display excessive endothelial cell growth leading to disorganization of the vascular network [Fong et al. 1995] whereas VEGFR2-mutant (Flk1-null) embryos die from a lack blood vessel network formation [Shalaby et al. 1995]. This duality is relevant to the MIE because receptor affinity for VEGF is ten-fold higher at VEGFR1 but kinase activity is ten-fold higher at VEGFR2 [Fischer et al. 2008; Shibuya, 2013]. As such, VEGFR2 promotes angiogenesis whereas VEGFR1 acts as a ligand-trap to prevent VEGF-A interaction with VEGFR2 [Hiratsuka et al. 1998]. However, VEGFR2 activation is considered the master switch of developmental angiogenesis. As such, the central concept of the MIE for this is inhibition of VEGFR2 activity. In addition to upstream effects on VEGF-A production or trapping, the MIE can be engaged by interference interference with VEGF-A binding to VEGFR2,  inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase activity, or reduced expression of the VEGFR2 protein. Given the complex nature of the VEGF-VEGFR system, this MIE must consider the state of the system overall.

	mmo:0000000	"""A structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of a 73,000-compound library using an HIF-1a: VEGF secretion assay identified 350 actives for followup [Xia et al. 2009]. Proximity Ligation Assays have been used to identify small molecule inhibitors of VEGF-A binding to its receptors [Gustafsdottir et al. 2008]. This assay is: fit for the purpose of monitoring the formation and inhibition of VEGF-A‚Äìreceptor complexes; defines chemical disruption of VEGF-A direct binding to its receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2); correlates well with results obtained by measuring receptor phosphorylation (VEGFR2); and allows evaluation of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (AC50) from a concentration-response curve.
The MIE for 'VEGFR2, inhibition' can be detected by measures of capacity (receptor density, expression levels) and bioactivity (tyrosine kinase activity) utilizing molecular probes and pharmacological reagents. As part of a broader AOP framework for vascular developmental toxicity, this MIE is anchored to genetic models having strong phenotypic evidence for adverse developmental outcomes. To organize what is known, an AngioKB knowledgebase was built from high-throughput PubMed queries utilizing Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms for vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in the embryo, fetus or development [Knudsen and Kleinstreuer, 2011]. These unstructured data were supplemented with information culled from the MGI Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MPO) Browser (http://www.informatics.jax.org, accessed October 31, 2011) for 'abnormal vasculogenesis' (MP:0001622, aberrant process of the initial establishment of the vascular network; 78 annotations) and 'abnormal angiogenesis' (MP:0000260, aberrant process of blood vessel formation and the subsequent remodeling process - does not refer to the initial establishment of the vascular network; 892 annotations). The relevant genes were then mapped to the ToxCast assay portfolio [1]. This yielded an overlap of 25 different sectors for pathways in blood vessel development [Knudsen and Kleinstreuer 2011], including the VEGF-VEGFR system covering many diverse studies in the open literature. The predictive signature for vascular disruption (pVDCs) incorporates several assays that directly measure VEGFR2 capacity (BSK_4H_VEGFRII_down and BSK_4H_VEGFRII_up) and bioactivity (NVS_ENZ_hVEGFR1 and NVS_ENZ_hVEGFR2). Importantly, VEGFR2 is inactive when non-liganded so measures of VEGFR2 capacity in the BioSeek (BSK) human 4H primary endothelial cell assay can register an increase or decrease in capacity depending on whether the MIE is being detected by a change in VEGFR2 protein levels [Kleinstreuer et al. 2014]. Liganding VEGFR2 leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues, which initiates signal transduction [Kendall et al. 1999]. This bioactivity is measured by a cell-free assay for human recombinant VEGFR2 that can register a concentration-dependent activation or inhibition [Knudsen et al. 2009; Sipes et al. 2011].
Analysis of VEGFR2 expression under different physiological and toxicological contexts can be determined by standard array-based assays to define regulation of the angiogenic transcriptome, as well as targeted non-array methods to characterize cell-specific profiles during in vivo and in vitro development [Dumont et al. 1995; Abbott et al. 2000; Drake et al. 2007; Murakami et al. 2011]. In addition, the ontogenetic profile of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 expression can be mapped in reporter zebrafish embryos under specific control of Flk or Flt gene regulatory elements [Tal et al. 2014]. Zebrafish possess 72 orthologs for 70% of human genes and 86% of 1318 human drug targets. Transgenic zebrafish that express reporter gene in developing blood vessels are fit for purpose to: visualize blood vessel formation during early development; localize and quantitate regional effects of chemicals on a phenotypic readout of angiogenic vessel formation; assess the reproducibility of vascular disruption across species; and evaluate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (AC50) from a concentration-response curve.
Downstream consequences to signal transduction can be measured by specific targets of VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase activity. Various examples of bioassays that measure the growth of blood vessels and the effects of specific inhibitors include in vitro assays of endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Some assays test human endothelial cells in primary culture models (e.g., HUVEC), stem-cell derived systems that are capable of de novo assembly into capillary networks, or genetically engineered mouse and zebrafish embryo, and computational models [Mueller et al. 2000; Dorrell et al. 2002; Xia et al. 2009; Chapell et al. 2013; Kleinstreuer et al. 2013; Shirinifard et al. 2013]. These assays and models are: fit for the purpose of defining optimal VEGF-A levels for angiogenesis; screening large inventories of small molecules for VEGF-A secretion over a range of chemical concentrations and low oxygen tension; linkage of the MIE with the physiological initiating event; and evaluation of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (AC50) from a concentration-response curve.

In vitro models are presently used to study EC function and screen for angiogenesis inhibitors based on effects on cell proliferation, sprouting behavior, and tubulogenesis. Sprouting is driven by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity whereas tubulogenesis shows MMP-dependence only in three-dimensional (3D) contexts. Furthermore, the VEGF-dependence is unclear in some tubulogenesis assay platforms and this further limits comparisons of EC tubulogenesis to VEGF-dependent vascular formation in vivo. As such, EC sprouting models that recapitulate MMP-dependent and VEGF-dependent endothelial cell invasion provide a more physiologic context for modeling early stages of angiogenesis and can be used to evaluate the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and invasion characteristic of angiogenic sprouting in vivo [Belair et al. 2016].

EC sprouting models that recapitulate matrix metalloproteinase-dependent and VEGF-dependent endothelial cell invasion provide a physiologic context for modeling early stages of angiogenesis. Endothelial cell migration is directed by chemotactic, haptotactic, and mechanotactic stimuli and degradation of the ECM to enable progression of the migrating cells. It requires the activation of several signaling pathways that converge on cytoskeletal remodeling and follows a molecular cascade in which the endothelial cells extend filopodial processes and progress forward [Lamalice et al. 2007]. Pro-angiogenic signals, such as VEGF-A, together with Notch signaling controls whether specific endothelial cells become leading &#39;tip cells&#39; or trailing &#39;stalk cells&#39;. Angiogenic sprouts then convert into endothelial tubules and form connections with other vessels, which requires the local suppression of motility and the formation of new cell-cell junctions [Eilken and Adams, 2010]. A unique method to encapsulate endothelial cells at a controlled cell density in hydrogel spheres surrounded by a synthetic ECM allows for quantitative analysis of EC sprouting for enhanced-throughput screening in a chemically-defined sprouting model [Belair et al. 2016]. Another approach to detecting effects on angiogenic sprouting dynamics is live-cell imaging in transgenic zebrafish embryos [Shirinfard et al. 2013].

These events commence as angioblasts migrate, proliferate, and assemble into a tubular network. With maturation, the endothelial tubules co-opt local stromal cells as pericytes and smooth muscle.

The assay is run in agonist or antagonist modes to detect chemical enhancement or suppression of tubulogenesis. Synthetic hydrogels are shown to promote robust in vitro network formation by HUVEC or iPSC-ECs as well as their utilization to detect putative vascular disruptive compounds [Nguyen et al. 2016].

Blood vessels are key regulators of organogenesis by providing oxygen, nutrients and molecular signals [Maltepe et al. 1997; Chung and Ferrara, 2011; Eshkar-Oren et al. 2015].

Vascular development commences in the early embryo with in situ formation of nascent vessels from angioblasts, leading to a primary capillary plexus (vasculogenesis). After the onset of blood circulation, the primary vascular pattern is further expanded as new vessels sprout from pre-existing vessels (angiogenesis). Both processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, are regulated by genetic signals and environmental factors dependent on anatomical region, physiological state, and developmental stage of the embryo. The developing vascular network is further shaped into a hierarchical system of arteries and veins, through progressive effects on blood vessel arborization, branching, and pruning (angioadaptation). These latter influences include hemodynamic forces, regional changes in blood flow, local metabolic demands and growth factor signals.

Disruptions in embryonic vascular patterning-adaptation may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes, including birth defects, angiodysplasias and cardiovascular disease, intrauterine growth restriction or prenatal death. Some chemicals may act as potential vascular disrupting compounds (pVDCs) altering the expression, activity or function of molecular signals regulating blood vessel development and remodeling. Critical pathways involve receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., growth factor-signaling), G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., chemokine signaling), and GPI-anchored receptors (e.g. uPAR system). Embryonic vascular disruption has been implicated in the etiology of human birth defects associated with medications taken by women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) [van Gelder et al. 2009] and thalidomide teratogenesis in animal studies [Therapontos et al. 2009; Vargesson et al. 2015].

Phenotypic readouts of angiogenic vessel formation of the intersegmental vessels (ISVs) in transgenic zebrafish embryos has been used to screen and validate anti-angiogenic compounds [Tran et al. 2007; Yano et al. 2012; Yozzo et al. 2013; Tal et al. 2014; McCollum et al. 2016]. In transgenic zebrafish embryos, live-cell imaging has been used to quantitatively detect the trajectory dynamics of vascular patterning [Clendenon et al. 2013; Shirinfard et al. 2013] and confocal cell imaging has been used to develop a quantitative assay capable of detecting relatively subtle changes (~8%) in ISV length relative to controls during chemical exposure [Tal et al. 2016]. Computational approaches have also been used to predict vascular insufficiency. For example, an in vitro signature for potential vascular disrupting chemicals (pVDCs) was mined for developmental toxicity based on ToxCast [Kleinstreuer et al. 2011; Knudsen and Kleinstreuer, 2011].

With respect to apical endpoints for developmental defects, the International Conference on Harmonization regulatory guidelines for embryo-fetal developmental toxicity testing (ICH 2005) require studies in both a rodent and a non-rodent species, usually rat and rabbit. The current paradigm was developed in response to the pandemic of phocomelia associated with maternal exposure to thalidomide during early pregnancy [Schardein 2000]; however, dose ranges of thalidomide that were teratogenic in the rabbit induced embryo-fetal loss in the rat [Janer et al. 2008]. This observation is consistent with current knowledge that the specificity of the manifestations of embryo-fetal toxicity may vary greatly between species, and even between strains within the same species [Hurtt et al. 2003; Janer et al. 2008; Knudsen et al. 2009; Rorije et al. 2012; Theunissen et al. 2016].

Mechanistically, some pathways may lead to specific types of malformations; however, a fundamental principle is that all four types of endpoints are important for hazard assessment.

	dcterms:description	"""Evidence Supporting Essentiality

Strong

Evidence supporting the formation of an AFB1-induced pro-mutagenic DNA adduct as the molecular initiating event (MIE) is strong and stems from many datasets in different biological systems. The formation of N7-AFB1-G DNA adducts after AFB1 exposure has been demonstrated across phyla, from bacteria through yeast, fish, birds, and including many mammalian systems up through non-human primates and humans (Croy et al., 1978; IARC, 1993; Cupid et al., 2004).

The reactive metabolite AFB1 exo-epoxide intercalates into DNA and then binds to the nucleophilic N7-G residue via an SN2 reaction. This N7-G DNA adduct can then spontaneously ring-open to form the more highly pro-mutagenic 8,9-dihydro-8-(2,6-diamino-4-oxo-3,4-pyrimid-9-yl-foramido-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1, or formamidopyrimidine adduct, AFB1-FAPy (Brown et al., 2006).

The essentiality of this MIE is demonstrated by the effects of modulation of metabolism to reactive forms. Inhibition of activation results in reduced formation of the critical exo-epoxide. Likewise, increased GST activity results in increased metabolism of the exo-epoxide to less toxic forms. In both cases, less reactive metabolite is available to form DNA adducts, resulting in fewer adducts (Guengerich et al., 1996). Pre-treatment of rats with oltipraz provides a specific example, wherein a 65-70% reduction in AFB1-induced DNA adducts was demonstrated due to increased GST activity; this corresponds with a subsequent 100% reduction in liver tumors (Roebuck et al., 1991; Kensler et al., 1998).


Another line of evidence for essentiality of the MIE is the recognized species difference in sensitivity to AFB1-induced liver tumors between mice and rats. Mice, with considerably increased metabolic activation of AFB1 to the exo-epoxide compared with rats, are nonetheless much less sensitive to AFB1-induced liver tumors (Degen and Neumann, 1981). This difference is believed to be due to the constitutive presence of GST-alpha activity in mice vs. rats, where this activity is not found (Monroe and Eaton, 1987).

Taxonomic Applicabilty

AFB1-induced DNA adduct measurements have focused mainly on mammalian species, including rats, mice, non-human primates, and humans; however, all species capable of metabolic activation of AFB1 to the exo-epoxide&mdash;including yeast, birds, and fish--will form the pro-mutagenic N7-AFB1-G DNA and AFB1-FAPy adducts described above (IARC, 1993).

How this Key Event works

The initial AFB1-induced pro-mutagenic DNA adduct is the 8,9-dihydro-8-(N7-guanyl)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1 adduct, or N7-AFB1-G (Croy et al., 1971). Once the exo-epoxide is bound to the N7-guanine, it can then ring-open to form the more highly pro-mutagenic 8,9-dihydro-8-(2,6-diamino-4-oxo-3,4-pyrimid-9-yl-foramido)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1, or formamidopyrimidine adduct, AFB1-FAPy (Brown et al., 2006).

The N7-AFB1-G adduct has a short half-life; it can spontaneously depurinate, leaving an apurinic (AP) site, a DNA lesion that typically is rapidly repaired (Denissenko et al., 1998). AP sites are the predominant background or endogenous lesion identified to date in DNA from control rats, with about 30,000 AP sites/cell present ubiquitously and continually (Swenberg et al., 2011). Thus, although the N7-AFB1-G is considered to be a pro-mutagenic lesion due to its capability to intercalate in DNA and its bulkiness (Bailey et al., 1996), it may not be the most important DNA adduct in the process of AFB1-induced tumorigenesis.

The AFB1-FAPy adduct has a longer half-life and demonstrates higher mutagenic efficiency or potency than the N7-AFB1-G (Brown et al., 2006). Data indicate that about 20% of the N7-AFB1-G adducts undergo opening of the ring to become AFB1-FAPy adducts (Bedard et al., 2005; Croy and Wogan, 1981a); others report that by about 24 post-exposure, AFB1-FAPy adducts predominate (Boysen et al., 2009; Croy and Wogan, 1981a). These adducts do not spontaneously depurinate, thus can accumulate over time, which likely contributes to their increased mutagenic efficacy (Smela et al., 2002).

The pro-mutagenicity of these two adducts was demonstrated by assessing their mutant frequencies (MF) in non-human primate-derived cell line COS-7; these cells employ an error-prone replication bypass repair system. The N7-AFB1-G adducts demonstrated a MF of 45% in COS-7 cells (Lin et al., 2014a), while the N7-AFB1-FAPy adduct MF was 97% (Lin et al., 2014b).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Sensitive analytical techniques are available for structural quantification of the AFB1-specific DNA adducts, including the N7-AFB1-G and AFB1-FAPy adducts (Himmelstein et al., 2009). DNA is isolated from tissues or cells and the isolated DNA subjected to neutral thermal or enzyme or acid hydrolysis. This releases the adducted bases, which are then further analyzed with specialized approaches. Techniques include high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or liquid chromatography (LC) separation coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS or LC-MS/MS). These techniques allow for definitive identification of the AFB1-related adducts using authentic standards. These capabilities can be further enhanced by the use of stable isotope-labelled test materials, e.g., with 13C, 15N, or D3. More sensitivity is reported with accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS) approaches; these require the use of radiolabelled (14C) test material but can detect adducts down into the attomolar range. Demonstration of dose-responses of adduct formation and temporal-response relationships are possible with administration of a variety of dose regimens, including repeated doses

The biological processes described in this AO, however, are not specific to a mutagenic MOA‚Äînor necessarily demonstrated for AFB1 exposure, but occur in development of HCC from all MOAs for HCC. Thus the final key events (AHF and HCC) represent the final stages of the pathway that leads to HCC from a mutagenic MOA or other MOAs. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a cancer of hepatocytes, and this disease is almost always lethal in the absence of extreme intervention measures (e.g., surgery, liver transplant). A number of factors are associated with HCC including AFB1 exposure, infection with hepatitis virus (HBV), and alcohol use. A common etiologic feature of HCC, whether produced by AFB1 intoxication, HBV, cirrhosis or something else, is the presence of oxidative damage in the liver. (Ravinayagam et al., 2012 Int J Hepatol; Kim et al., 2011 J Ginseng Res).
AFB1 produces specific pro-mutagenic adducts that are believed to lead to a mutation in the p53 gene, which affects its functioning. P53 is generally considered to be a tumor suppressor gene involved in cell cycle regulation and initiation of apoptosis. When applied in vitro to hepatocytes, AFB1 produced cellular swelling, bleb formation, and lysis. These effects may be due to lipid peroxidation affecting the cell membrane from the downstream dialdehyde metabolite of the AFB1 epoxide metabolites. (Mathijs et al., 2009, 2010) This damage is reflective of oxidative stress, a known contributor to HCC (Ravinayagam et al., 2012 Int J Hepatol; Kim et al., 2011 J Ginseng Res). As discussed elsewhere in this AOP, the Nrf2-Keap1 anti-oxidant response induced by a number of chemoprotective agents can be quite effective in preventing HCC [3-8], even in the presence of a significant burden of N7- AFB1-G adducts. 
The cellular damage produced by exposure to AFB1 likely leads to chronic inflammation, also a contributor to tumor progression. (Ellinger-Ziegelbauer et al., 2004) Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) breaks down heme to bilirubin and biliverdin that have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities (Keum et al., 2006; Caballero et al 2004) , thus countering the inflammatory response. The induction of HO-1 is part of the Nrf2-Keap1 anti-oxidant response.  
From a systems biology and biochemistry perspective, the presence of oxidative stress and inflammation, although not specific only to AFB1 exposure, are strong contributors to cancer progression.(Ohnishi et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2013; Higgs et al., 2014).

This type of mutation is observed in the mutants seen in surrogate gene mutation assays using AFB1 exposureA high frequency of codon 249 p53 mutations occurs in human tumors in high AFB1 exposure regions.Hence, codon 249 of the p53 gene contains a base pair susceptible to insufficient or misrepair of DNA adducts.

Puisieux et al. (1991) provide evidence that the AFB1 epoxide adduct binds preferentially to codon 249 of the p53 gene. Using a plasmid with containing full-length human p53 DNA, adduct formation was observed in exons 5, 6, 7 and 8 (a total of 1086 bases) and 20% of the bases were targeted by AFB1 with a preference for guanine residues. Binding of AFB1 to p53 sequences was restricted to fewer residues and was more specific for guanine than was the binding of B[a]P (Puisieux et al.,1991). Binding of AFB1 in the region around codon 249 of p53 AFB1 was reported to be &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; than that of B[a]P. The last nucleotide of codon 249 is a guanine and was targeted by AFB1 but not by B[a]P. This guanine residue is the mutational hotspot in human liver cancers from patients in high AFB1 exposure regions.

While mutations at codon 249 of the p53 gene have been observed in association with HCC in humans, the question remains whether this mutation occurs as a direct result of adduct formation at this site or by some different mechanism..In human HepG2 hepatocytes exposed to microsomally activated AFB1, a dose-dependent increase in G:C to T:A transversions were observed at 10 additional locations using ligation-mediated PCR, and at 4 additional locations using terminal-transferred dependent PCR.(Denissenko et al.,1998). These authors suggest that codon 249 may not present a key adduct site. However, other more recently published data identified codon 249 of the P53 gene as an unusually mutagenic adduct conformation based on the local DNA sequence and concluded that a higher mutation rate may occur there rather than at other locations because of increased DNA polymerase bypass (Pussieux et al., 1991; Lin et al., 2014a,b).

Induced Mutation in Critical Genes

The AFB1-induced pro-mutagenic DNA adduct is either not repaired or is mis-repaired resulting in a mutation in one or more critical genes. In bacteria and mammalian cells (both in vitro and in vivo) the primary mutation associated with AFB1 is a guanine to thymine transversion (Foster et al., 1983; Dycaico et al., 1996). A G:T transversion is expected for the pro-mutagenic DNA adduct AFB1-FAPy.

A specific critical mutation in codon 249 of the p53 gene has been identified in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (See section below on essentiality).

The induction of mutation occurs within the nucleus of cells and involves permanent alterations in the primary DNA sequence that is passed to subsequent cell generations and, thus, is heritable.

Evidence Supporting Essentiality

A specific critical mutation in the p53 gene has been identified in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Demonstrating that AFB1 can induce this specific p53 gene mutation would be the highest level of evidence that AFB1-induced HCC involves mutation as a KE. Absent such information, the next best level of evidence is the induction of the specific type of mutation (G:C to T:A transversion) in a variety of gene mutation assays measuring a range of target genes.

The codon 249 mutation is present in a significant proportion of human HCCs. In fact codon 249 mutation is detected in up to 50% of liver cancers in Qidong, China (Hsu et al., 1991) and in Mozambique, both areas with high likelihood of AFB1 exposure. The codon 249 G:C to T:A mutation in the third base is seen in up to 75% of HCC in high-incidence areas of China and East Africa (Gouas et al., 2009). In contrast, this specific mutation is very rare in HCC from areas with no or low exposure to AFB1 (Hsu et al. 1991 and Bressac et al. Nature, 350:429-431, 1991). This mutation is also very rare in other types of tumors (Gouas et al., 2009). According to Gouas et al. (2009), populations with AFB1 exposure are likely to be exposed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) as well and the effects of each are difficult to separate.This mutation is very rare in HCC from non/low -aflatoxin areas (Hsu et al. 1991 and Bressac et al., 1991) and also very rare in other types of tumors.

Some indirect evidence of the essentiality of mutation in tumor development is provided by the clear species difference between adult mice and adult rats both in the induction of surrogate gene mutations and in the induction of tumors. Adult mice exposed to AFB1 do not get tumors and there is no increase in mutant frequency (MF) for Big Blue mice exposed as adults. That is, Lac I mutants from the AFB1- exposed adult mice showed a spontaneous mutational spectrum. Rats, however, showed a large increase in MF and, more specifically a large increase in G:C to T:A transversions (Dycaico et al., 1996). In addition, for mice there is an difference between neonata and adult mice. Neonatal mice treated with AFB1 (6 mg/kg&mdash;a dose that does result in tumors) showed an increase in cII mutation with G:C to T:A transversion as the major mutation. Adult mice treated at 6 and 60 mg/kg (doses that do not produce tumors) did not have a significant increase in cII mutation (but did give a different mutational spectrum than controls) (Chen et al. 2010).

	mmo:0000000	"""Historically the detection of critical cancer gene specific mutations has not been technically feasible. A newly developed method, allele specific competitive blocker-polymerase chain reaction (ACB-PCR) has proven useful in providing such information, and data on specific chemical-induced mutations are available for a very small number of chemicals (Parsons et al., 2010). Unfortunately, there are no data for AFB1.

There are, however, a number of gene mutation assays that have been widely used for determining the general ability of chemicals, including AFB1 to induce mutations.These assays use selection methods that allow only mutant cells to survive and grow. The AS52 in vitro gene mutation assay using the gpt gene, and 6-thioguanine selection has been used to demonstrate that AFB1 exposure increases the MF at the gpt gene. In vivo transgenic assays use molecular methods to recover the transgene from isolated DNA and to evaluate the MF in the transgene. Molecular methods can detect the presence (above a certain sensitivity level) of mutant cells. DNA from tumors can be sequenced to determine the presence of mutations in specific genes. DNA sequencing has been used on human tumors to detect the presence of the Codon 249 p53 mutation.

	dcterms:description	"""The reactive exo-epoxide is formed in hepatocytes (or extra-hepatically) by metabolism of the parent AFB1 by CYP450 (Larsson et al., 1990; Larsson and Tjalve, 1993). The reactive metabolite then escapes the endoplasmic reticulum where the CYP450 is located. The reactive metabolite must evade conjugation with GSH in the cytoplasm or binding with other cytoplasmic nucleophiles. It then traverses the nuclear membrane in order to reach the cell nucleus and the nuclear DNA. Once the reactive metabolite is in the cell nucleus, binding to nuclear DNA and the formation of DNA adducts can occur.

Biological Process: Production of Reactive Electrophiles

Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) can be oxidized to a variety of metabolites, many of which can be further metabolized, for example by conjugation with glutathione (GSH) via Glutathione-S-transferase (GST). In order for DNA binding and formation of a pro-mutagenic DNA adduct to occur, AFB1 must be metabolized via Cytochrome P450 metabolism to a specific highly reactive form of AFB1, the exo-epoxide AFB1-8,9-epoxide. CYP3A4 forms the exo-form of this reactive epoxide only. CYP1A2, inducible in liver, forms both the exo- and the endo-epoxides; in human liver, CYP1A2 metabolism occurs with a lower Vmax (enzymatic rate) and higher Km (half-maximal concentrations) than CYP3A4 (Degen and Neumann,1981; Groopman and Kensler, 2005; Guengerich et al., 1996; Ueng et al., 1995). Figure 1, from Pottenger et al., 2014, depicts the metabolism of AFB1.

Metabolic activation of AFB1 occurs mainly in the liver, where the highest levels of the CYP isozymes are located. Competitive metabolism with other hepatic and extra-hepatic P450 isozymes may decrease the proportion of the specific metabolite, AFB1-8,9-epoxide; this can reduce the effectiveness of hepatic activation of AFB1. Alternatively, induction of either hepatic or extra-hepatic GST activity can reduce the levels of AFB1-epoxide available for reaction with DNA by increasing conjugation of the epoxide with GSH. This conjugation renders the epoxide inactive and directs it towards eventual elimination (Guengerich et al., 1996).

Figure 1 was obtained from Pottenger et al., 2014.

The AFB1 pro-mutagenic DNA adduct is most likely the 8,9-dihydro-8-(N7-guanyl)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1 adduct, or N7-AFB1-G (Croy et al., 1978). Once the exo-epoxide is bound to the N7-guanine, it is subject to ring-opening to form the more highly pro-mutagenic 8,9-dihydro-8-(2,6-diamino-4-oxo-3,4-pyrimid-9-yl-foramido)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1; this is known as the formamidopyrimidine adduct or AFB1-FAPy adduct (Brown et al., 2006).

The reactive exo-epoxide is formed in hepatocytes (or extra-hepatically) by metabolism of the parent AFB1 by CYP450 (Larsson et al., 1990; Larsson and Tjalve, 1993). The reactive metabolite then escapes the endoplasmic reticulum where the CYP450 is located. The reactive metabolite must evade conjugation with GSH in the cytoplasm or binding with other cytoplasmic nucleophiles. It then traverses the nuclear membrane in order to reach the cell nucleus and the nuclear DNA. Once the reactive metabolite is in the cell nucleus, binding to nuclear DNA and the formation of DNA adducts can occur.

Level of Biological Organization&nbsp;: Molecular

Metabolic activation of AFB1 occurs at the intracellular level, with sub-cellular organelles involved due to the localization of CYP450 in the endoplasmic reticulum, coupled with the epoxide hydratase; GST is localized in the cytosol (Guengerich et al., 1996). Organ architecture also plays a role, as the structure of the liver is orientated around the O2 gradient set by the portal artery and hepatic vein; hepatocytes nearest the portal artery demonstrate increased tissue oxygen while those around the portal vein have decreased tissue O2 and correspondingly higher levels of CYP450 activity.

Evidence for Chemical Initiation of this Initial Molecular Event

Pre-MIE: There is an extensive database on AFB1 in many different systems demonstrating formation of the AFB1 exo-epoxide. This database includes several mammalian species (humans, non-human primates, rats, mice) in addition to birds (turkeys) and fish (Eaton and Gallagher, 1994; IARC, 1993).

Evidence Supporting Essentiality

Pre-MIE

Strong

Many studies show that in the absence of AFB1 metabolic activation, tumors do not occur. Treatment of rats with the CYP450-inhibitor and GST-inducer oltipraz reduces the levels of AFB1 DNA adducts by 65-70%, and the later-forming altered hepatic foci (AHF) and liver tumors are also reduced by 97 and 100%, respectively; thus, no hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) form in the oltipraz-treated rats dosed with AFB1 (Roebuck et al., 1991). More recent data show even more effective prevention of tumors and of hepatic foci in rats pre-treated with a triterpenoid, 1-[2-cyano-3-,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oyl]imidazole (CDDO-Im) (Johnson et al., 2014). The pre-treated rats were reported with a 70% reduction of AFB1-induced adducts in urine but had 100% inhibition of tumors, and only 1 rat out of 23 pre-treated had any altered hepatic foci (AHF). There are similar data in humans treated with oltipraz. Kensler et al. (1998) report a significant reduction in a biomarker of exposure AFB1-induced albumin adducts, supporting the human relevance of this metabolic activation

Another line of evidence for essentiality of the pre-MIE is the recognized difference in sensitivity to AFB1-induced liver tumors between mice and rats (Degen and Neumann, 1981). Mice, have considerably increased metabolic activation of AFB1 to the exo-epoxide compared to rats; mice are nonetheless much less sensitive to AFB1-induced liver tumors. It is thought that this difference is due to the constitutive presence of GST-alpha activity in mice vs rats, where this activity is not found.
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Formation of the exo-epoxide can be produced with in vitro systems and detected using techniques for structural quantitation of AFB1 metabolites (Himmelstein et al., 2009), including liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). By using subcellular fractions (e.g., microsomes), cellular homogenates, or cells in culture, it is possible to measure formation of AFB1 exo-epoxide. Such data can also be collected from in vivo systems; samples of plasma or blood from AFB1-treated animals can be analyzed for the AFB1 exo-epoxide with similar mass spectrometric based detection systems (e.g., LC-MS/MS). Samples of blood from humans in AFB1-endemic regions have demonstrated presence of AFB1-albumin adducts, which are formed from the AFB1 exo-epoxide. AFB1-treated animals may also provide tissue samples for analysis of AFB1 exo-epoxide. Special trapping techniques may be required as the reactive AFB1 exo-epoxide metabolite has a short half-life in biological matrices.

[5-8]    The growth and occurrence of foci are expressed as the number of AHF in a volume of liver, possibly the entire liver, and the volume fraction of the liver occupied by AHF.  [9] Both of these reflect focal growth because single cell foci are not detectable with the immunohistochemical staining technique. The assumption is that single transformed cells in which apoptosis is blocked by tumor-critical mutations will grow into AHF.

	dc:source	"AOPWiki" ;
	dcterms:description	"""The AFB1-induced pro-mutagenic DNA adducts, N7-AFB1-G and /or AFB1-FAPy, are recognized by DNA repair proteins or systems, which then initiate their repair processes (Bedard and Massey, 2006).  
Although there are no data specific to AFB1 for this key event of insufficient/mis-repair of DNA, it is a process known to occur and known to result in mutations. The system that recognizes the damage depends in part upon which stage of the cell cycle is in progress when the pro-mutagenic DNA adducts are recognized. Initial steps can include recruitment of a series of proteins specific to that repair system and can also include blocking of progress of the DNA replication fork. This latter step ensures that DNA replication waits for repair to occur before proceeding, preventing replication of the damaged DNA, thus avoiding a mutation when the repair might otherwise faithfully copy the error.
Mis-repair: For many of the DNA repair systems the repair process is quite faithful; that is, damage is correctly repaired with the correct or original base substituted for the adducted base. This is not always the case, however, and erroneous repair is one source of mutations, when an incorrect base inserted opposite a correct or an adducted base (mis-repair). 
Insufficient repair: An alternative route to mutation can occur when on-going DNA replication is not stopped, and DNA replication occurs across an adducted (typically non-informational lesion) base that has not undergone any repair (insufficient repair). This situation can result in the incorporation of an incorrect base into the nascent DNA strand.  
Insufficient repair or mis-repair results in an incorrect base incorporated into the nascent DNA strand, an error which is then eventually replicated, resulting in a so-called ‚Äúfixed‚Äù change in the primary DNA sequence; that is, a mutation.  This mutation may be silent (no impact on protein product structure and/or function) or expressed (non-functional or differently functional protein product). Depending on the location or gene of the expressed mutation, it may have a substantial or slight biological impact, or can have no impact.  For example, if the mutation is located in codon 249 of the p53 gene and is expressed, there is potential for substantial biological impact, including steps on a pathway to carcinogenesis. There is less likelihood of a substantial biological impact when a mutation results in no change in the coded amino acid due to lack of stringency in the genetic code. Likewise a change in amino acid sequence may not result in any change in the activity or function of the protein product.

Level of Biological Organization
Repair of DNA adducts occurs at the sub-cellular level, as the target is nuclear DNA.  For AFB1, the cross-species critical target is repair of hepatocyte nuclear DNA, as the eventual AFB1-induced tumor is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is initiated in hepatocytes.

Evidence Supporting Essentiality
Strong
Evidence supporting the insufficient repair or mis-repair of pro-mutagenic DNA adducts is strong, but mainly indirect.  This evidence comes from different biological systems and datasets, mostly mammalian, and is based in large part on the biological understanding of a DNA-reactive mode of action requiring a change in primary DNA sequence (mutation). Such a change occurs when DNA lesions are not repaired prior to cell replication (Preston and Williams, 2005; Jarabek et al, 2009; Pottenger et al., 2014).  AFB1 forms two types of pro-mutagenic adducts: N7-AFB1-G and AFB1-FAPy DNA adducts, and resulting mutations are predominantly G:C to T:A transversions. These changes are the expected result of such adducts not being repaired or undergoing mis-repair (Bedard and Massey, 2006; Lin et al., 2014a,b).
Data from diverse cell types and systems demonstrate that AFB1-induced DNA adducts are repaired by a variety of DNA repair processes, including SOS repair, nucleotide excision repair (NER), homologous recombination (HR), and post-replication repair (Bedard and Massey, 2006).  The work by Guo et al. (2005), conducted in transgenic yeast modified to express human CYP1A2, is particularly useful as several DNA repair systems were evaluated for efficacy towards the AFB1-induced DNA adducts.  Mutations were more likely to be induced in strains deficient in certain repair systems. Mutations were also induced in strains with active secondary repair pathways; these include pathways for error-prone post-replication repair and those relying on apurinic endonucleases. However, NER appears to be most important for repair of AFB1-induced adducts in mammalian systems (Bedard and Massey, 2006).
The codon 249 of the p53 gene has been identified as a particular target of AFB1-induced adduction and subsequent mutation. Using DNA polymerase fingerprint analysis, Puiseux et al. (1991) showed a specificity of AFB1 epoxide binding for this codon. This  specificity was not found with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), although B[a]P also forms bulky, intercalating epoxides, similar to AFB1 exo-epoxide, which result in bulky N7-B[a]P-G adducts. 
Essentiality of this key event of insufficient or mis-repair is supported in part by datasets demonstrating that a reduction in AFB1 adduct burden (e.g., 65-70% reduction) results in a significantly reduced or even eliminated altered hepatic foci (AHF) and liver tumor burden in experimental animals (Roebuck et al., 1991; Elegbede and Gould, 2002; Yates et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2014). Data from studies in human populations show that treatment with known modulators of AFB1 metabolism (e.g., with oltipraz or chlorophyllin) resulted in reduced urinary levels of N7-AFB1-G, derived from AFB1-induced DNA adducts (Egner et al., 2006). These treatments are also observed to decrease levels of a human biomarker of exposure, AFB1-induced albumin adducts (Kensler et al., 1998).  A similar dataset in rats pre-treated with the triterpenoid, ODDC-Im, provides an even more convincing picture, wherein a chronic bioassay demonstrated a ~60% reduction in AFB1 DNA adducts, complete elimination of liver tumors, and nearly complete elimination of altered hepatic foci (Johnson et al., 2014).
Some studies suggest that eukaryotic NER expression is induced by exposure to phytochemicals (Gross-Steinmeyer et al. 2010), and alteration of DNA repair has been suggested as a pathway of chemoprevention for AFB1 carcinogenesis (Gross-Steinmeyer and Eaton, 2012).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""One approach would be quantitation of chemical-specific DNA adducts, such as the N7-AFB1-G and AFB1-FAPy DNA adducts, before and after DNA repair occurs combined with DNA sequence data to determine whether the decrease in adducts were correctly repaired or not.  While this would be a very satisfying dataset, it is not a very practical approach.  Measurement of mutations following AFB1 treatment of yeast with a variety of DNA repair deficiencies has been used to elucidate the role of DNA repair (Guo et al., 2005) by comparing mutant frequency (MF) in wild type vs. DNA repair deficient strains. In this instance MF serves as a marker for the insufficient or mis-repair of the AFB1 DNA adducts.  The exquisitely sensitive analytical techniques available for structural quantification of  these chemical-specific DNA adducts require specialized analytical chemistry techniques conducted on DNA isolated from tissues or cells and subjected to neutral thermal or enzyme or acid hydrolysis; this releases the adducted bases, which are then further analyzed with specialized approaches (Himmelstein et al., 2009). Demonstration of adduct dose-responses and temporal relationships are possible with administration of a variety of doses, including repeated doses.

The above chapters belong to the AOP entitled: Chronic binding of antagonist to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) during brain development induces impairment of learning and memory abilities since the general characteristic of the NMDA receptor biology is the same for both AOPs.
Additional text, specific for this AOP:
At resting membrane potentials, NMDA receptors are inactive. Depending on the specific impulse train received, the NMDA receptor activation triggers long term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD) (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Luscher and Malenka, 2012). LTP (the opposing process to LTD) is the long-lasting increase of synaptic strength. For LTP induction both pre- and postsynaptic neurons need to be active at the same time because the postsynaptic neuron must be depolarized when glutamate is released from the presynaptic bouton to fully relieve the Mg2+ block of NMDARs that prevents ion flows through it.  Sustained activation of AMPA or KA receptors by, for instance, a train of impulses arriving at a pre-synaptic terminal, depolarizes the post-synaptic cell, releasing Mg2+ inhibition and thus allowing NMDA receptor activation. Unlike GluA2-containing AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors are permeable to calcium ions as well as being permeable to other ions. Thus NMDA receptor activation leads to a calcium influx into the post-synaptic cells, a signal that is instrumental in the activation of a number of signalling cascades (Calcium-dependent processes are describe in Key Event Calcium influx, increased). Postsynaptic Ca2+ signals of different amplitudes and durations are able to induce either LPT or LTD. 
Conversely to LTP, LTD  is induced by repeated activation of the presynaptic neuron at low frequencies without postsynaptic activity (Luscher and Malenka, 2012). Therefore, under physiological conditions LTD is one of several processes that serves to selectively weaken specific synapses in order to make constructive use of synaptic strengthening caused by LTP. This is necessary because, if allowed to continue increasing in strength, synapses would ultimately reach a ceiling level of efficiency, which would inhibit the encoding of new information (Purves, 2008). 
LTD is an activity-dependent reduction in the efficacy of neuronal synapses lasting hours or longer following a long patterned stimulus. It has also been found to occur in different types of neurons however, the most common neurotransmitter involved in LTD is L-glutamate that acts on the NMDARs, AMPAR, KARs and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). It can result from strong synaptic stimulation (as occurs e.g. in the cerebellar Purkinje cells) or from persistent weak synaptic stimulation (as in the hippocampus) resulting mainly from a decrease in postsynaptic AMPA receptor density, although a decrease in presynaptic neurotransmitter release may also play a role. Moreover, cerebellar LTD has been hypothesized to be important for motor learning and hippocampal LTD may be important for the clearing of old memory traces (Nicholls et al., 2008; Mallere et al., 2010). The main molecular mechanism underlying-LTD is the phosphorylation of AMPA glutamate receptors and their synaptic elimination (Ogasawara et al., 2008). 
It is now commonly understood in the field of spine morphology that long lasting NMDAR-dependent LTD causes dendritic spine shrinkage, reduces  number of synaptic AMPA receptors (Calabrese et al., 2014), possibly leading to synaptic dysfunction, contributing to decreased neuronal network function and impairment of learning and memory processes.

No OECD methods are available to measure the activation state of NMDA receptors. 
The measurement of the activation or the inhibition of NMDA receptors is done indirectly by recording the individual ion channels that are selective to Na+, K+ and Ca2+ by the patch clamp technique. This method relies on lack of measurable ion flux when NMDA ion channel is closed, whereas constant channel specific conductance is recorded at the open state of the receptor (Blanke and VanDongen, 2009). Furthermore, this method is based on the prediction that activation or inhibition of an ion channel results from an increase in the probability of being in the open or closed state, respectively (Ogdon and Stanfield, 2009; Zhao et al., 2009). 
The whole-cell patch clamp recording techniques have also been used to study synaptically-evoked NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs, respectively) in brain slices and neuronal cells, allowing the evaluation of the activated or inhibited state of the receptor.
Microelectrode array (MEA) recordings are used to measure mainly spontaneous network activity of cultured neurons (Keefer et al., 2001, Gramowski et al., 2000 and Gopal, 2003; Johnstone et al., 2010). However, using specific agonists and antagonists of a receptor, including NMDAR, MEA technology can be used to measure evoked activity, including glutamatergic receptor function (Lantz et al., 2014). For example it has been shown that MEA-coupled neuronal cortical networks are very sensitive to pharmacological manipulation of the excitatory ionotropic glutamatergic transmission (Frega et al., 2012). MEAs can also be applied in higher throughput platforms to facilitate screening of numerous chemical compounds (McConnell et al., 2012).
Excessive excitability can be also measured directly by evaluating the level of the extracellular glutamate using the enzyme-based microelectrode arrays. This technology is  capable of detecting glutamate in vivo, to assess the effectiveness of hyperexcitability modulators on glutamate release in brain slices. Using glutamate oxidase coated ceramic MEAs coupled with constant voltage amperometry, it is possible to measure resting glutamate levels and synaptic overflow of glutamate after K(+) stimulation in brain slices (Quintero et al., 2011).
Neuronal network function can be also measured using optical detection of neuronal spikes both in vivo and in vitro (Wilt et al., 2013).
Drebrin immunocytochemistry: drebrin, a major actin-filament-binding protein localized in mature dendritic spines is a target of calpain mediated proteolysis under excitotoxic conditions induced by the overactivation of NMDARs. In cultured rodent neurons, degradation of drebrin was confirmed by the detection of proteolytic fragments, as well as a reduction in the amount of full-length drebrin. The NMDA-induced degradation of drebrin in mature neurons occurres concomitantly with a loss of f-actin. Biochemical analyses using purified drebrin and calpain revealed that calpain degraded drebrin directly in vitro. These findings suggest that calpain-mediated degradation of drebrin is mediated by excitotoxicity, regardless of whether they are acute or chronic. Drebrin (A and E) regulates the synaptic clustering of NMDARs. Therefore, degradation of drebrin can be used as a readout for excitotoxicity induced by NMDAR overactivation. Degradation of drebrin can be evaluated quantitatively by Western blot analysis (mRNA evel) or by immunocytochemistry (at protein level) (Chimura et al., 2015: Sekino et al., 20069.
NMDAR overactivation-induced long lasting LTD can be measured by the dendritic spine shrinkage by quantification of cofilin and phospho-cofilin in neurons expressing eGFP and combined with immunocytochemical techniques (Calabrese et al., 2014).

The text specific for this AOP:
It is now well accepted that modest activation of NMDARs leading to modest increases in postsynaptic calcium are optimal for triggering LTD (Lledo et al. 1998; Bloodgood  and Sabatin, 2007; Bloodgood et al. 2009), whereas much stronger activation of NMDARs leading to much larger increases in postsynaptic calcium are required to trigger LTP (Luscher and  Malenka, 2012; Malenka 1994). Indeed, high-frequency stimulation causes a strong temporal summation of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), and depolarization of the postsynaptic cell is sufficient to relieve the Mg2+ block of the NMDAR and allow a large amount of calcium to enter into the postsynaptic cells. Therefore, intra-cellular calcium is measured as a readout for evaluation NMDAR stimulation.

	dcterms:description	"""Biological state:
In the brain, neurons never work alone. They create a network where the activity of one cell directly influences many others. Each neuron is a specialized cell and when activated, it fires an electrochemical signal along the axon. A neuron fires only if the total signal received at the cell body from the dendrites exceeds a certain level (the firing threshold). The strength of the signal received by a neuron (and therefore its chances of firing) critically depends on the efficacy of the synapses. Each synapse actually contains a synaptic cleft with neurotransmitter that transmits a signal across the gap.  During synaptic transmission neurotransmitters are released by a presynaptic neuron and bind to and activate the receptors of the postsynaptic neuron  in response to a threshold of action potential. Synaptic transmission relies on: the availability of the neurotransmitter; the release of the neurotransmitter by exocytosis; the binding of the postsynaptic receptor by the neurotransmitter; the functional response of the postsynaptic cell; and the subsequent removal or deactivation of the neurotransmitter. 
Neurons form complex networks of synapses through which action potentials travel. When the nerve impulse arrives at the synapse, it may cause the release of neurotransmitters, which influence another (postsynaptic) neuron. The postsynaptic neurons receive inputs from many additional neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory. The excitatory and inhibitory influences are summed (neural summation) resulting in inhibition or "firing" (i.e., generate an action potential) if the threshold potential has been reached. The voltage at which an action potential is triggered happens if  enough voltage-dependent sodium channels are activated and  the net inward sodium current exceeds all outward currents (Kolb and Whishaw, 2003). Therefore, at the beginning of the action potential, the Na+ channels open and Na+ moves into the axon, causing depolarization. Re-polarization occurs when the K+ channels open and K+ moves out of the axon. This creates a change in polarity between the  outside of the cell and the inside. The impulse travels down from the axon hillock in one direction only, to the axon terminal. Here, the  neurotransmitter is released releasing neurotransmitter at the synaptic cleft to pass along information to another adjacent neuron. Excitatory inputs bring a neuron closer to a firing threshold, while inhibitory inputs bring the neuron farther from threshold. An action potential is an "all-or-none" event; neurons whose membranes have not reached threshold will not fire, while those that do, will fire. 
One of the most influential researchers into neurological systems (Donald Hebb) postulated that learning consisted principally in altering the "strength" of synaptic networking. Recent research in cognitive science, in particular in the area of non-conscious information processing, have further demonstrated the enormous capacity of the human mind to learn simple input-output co-variations from extremely complex stimuli. Consequently, the neurodegeneration and cell death disrupt the natural rhythms of brain network communication. Cognitive disorders are primarily associated with dysfunction of the neurons of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and with changes mainly in NMDARs function (Wang et al, 2015).  
Biological compartments:
The interface through which neurons interact with their neighbours usually consists of several axon terminals connected via synapses to dendrites on other neurons. If the hippocampal or cortical neurons are damaged or killed by the over-activation of receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, such as the NMDA, kainate and AMPA receptors, the neuronal networking and number of synapses are decreased. Indeed, it has been proved that lesions of the hippocampus in humans prevent the acquisition of new episodic memories suggesting that hippocampus-dependent memory is mediated, at least in part, by hippocampal synaptic plasticity that is a prominent feature of hippocampal synapses of the  neuronal network (Neves et al., 2008). Since the finding that the hippocampus plays a pivotal role in long-term memory consolidation (dogma, well established fact in the literature, described in the text books; e.g. Andersen et al., 2007; Byrne, 2008; Eichenbaum, 2002), many proposals have been made regarding its specific role.  A prominent view of the mechanisms underlying consolidation of episodic memories involves fast formation (e.g., via Hebbian mechanisms) of strong associations between hippocampal sparse patterns of activity and distributed neocortical representations.
Recent research on the primate prefrontal cortex discovered that the pyramidal cell circuits that generate the persistent firing underlying spatial working memory communicate through synapses on spines containing NMDARs with NR2B subunits (GluN2B) in the post-synaptic density. This contrasts with synapses in the hippocampus and primary visual cortex, where GluN2B receptors are both synaptic and extrasynaptic. Cholinergic stimulation of nicotinic Œ±7 receptors within the glutamate synapse is necessary for NMDAR actions (Wang and Arnsten, 2015).
General role in biology:
Glutamatergic neurotransmission (NMDA, AMPA and KA receptors)
The network of glutamatergic neurons is heavily involved in long-term synaptic plasticity, the main process linked to learning and memory. At the same time over-activation of these neurons (excitotoxicity) leads to  neuronal cell death that can be mediated by increased levels of extracellular glutamate or a molecule that behaves as its analogue. Glutamate acts at a variety of ionotropic receptors, including AMPARs, kainate receptors, and NMDARs. The NMDARs have been of particular interest due to their unique properties.  They require neuronal depolarization to relieve their Mg++ block, and are permeable to Ca++ that can initiate second-messenger signalling events, such as mediating neuroplasticity or negative feedback through Ca++-sensitive K+ channels. There have been extensive studies on the glutamate NMDAR and AMPAR mechanisms underlying long-term synaptic plasticity in the primary visual cortex and in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus (Liu et al., 2004; Cho et al., 2009; L√ºscher and Malenka, 2012). 
Neuronal network function and long-term plasticity is also regulated by the levels of AMPAR expression as the number of AMPARs inserted into the post-synaptic density can mediate the degree of spine depolarization and thus the NMDAR opening.  Synaptic plasticity in the mature visual cortex appears to be governed by GluN2A subunits, which have faster kinetics than GluN2B. GluN2B receptors are expressed in synapses early in development, but many move to extra-synaptic locations in the mature visual cortex and hippocampus (Goebel-Goody et al., 2009). The actions of NMDARs on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex neuronal circuitry network underlying spatial working memory in primates and it mechanism is described in detail by Wang and Arnsten (2015). In the hippocampus, there is some evidence that long-term potentiation (LTP) is mediated by synaptic GluN2A, while long-term depression is mediated by extrasynaptic GluN2B receptors (Liu et al., 2004).
Kainate receptors (KARs) also play an important role in neuronal network function. They play a major function in the pre-synaptic terminal, in particular in the hippocampus. Activation of kainate receptors in have been shown to regulate glutamate release (Jane et al., 2009) and to both depress and factilitate transmission in different synapses.  Pre-synaptic kainate receptors in the hippocampus facilitate AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated transmission at mossy fibre-CA3 synapses (Lauri et al, 2005). Activation of post-synaptic KARs facilitates activation of NMDARs as it has been described in the context of DomA exposure.
Role of other neurotransmitters
It is important to stress that other classical neurotransmitter systems also play an important role in learning and memory processes (Blokland 1996).  The role of the most critical neurotransmitters has been evaluated in a meta-analysis based on studies of four behavioral tasks  relevant for evaluation of rat cognitive functions such as  Morris water maze, radial maze, passive avoidance, and spontaneous alternation (Myhrer, 2003). Calculation of impact factors (percentage of significant effects of chemical agents like agonists, antagonists, neurotoxins) showed that glutamate was ranking highest (93), followed by GABA (81), dopamine (81), acetylcholine (81), serotonin (55), and norepinephrine (48). 
GABA-ergic receptors: indeed, presynaptic GABA B receptors mediate GABA-dependent inhibition of glutamate release, impacting plasticity of hippocampal synapses and hippocampus-dependent memory function (Vigot et al., 2006). A critical link between GABABR heterodimer conformational dynamics and local regulation of release probability at hippocampal synapses has been recently proved (Laviv et al., 2010).
5-Hydroxytrytamine (serotonin) type 3A receptors (5-HT3ARs), as the only ligand-gated ion channels in the serotonin receptor family, are known to regulate neuronal excitation and release of GABA in hippocampal interneurons, playing also  an important role in glutamatergic synaptic plasticity. Deletion of the 5-HT3AR gene in transgenic mice abolished NMDAR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in hippocampal CA1 synapses in slices.  In addition, 5-HT3ARs disruption inhibited AMPARs internalization, without altering basal surface levels of AMPARs. These observations revealed an important role of 5-HT3ARs in NMDAR-dependent long-term depression, which is critical for learning behaviours (Yu et al., 2014). 
The cholinergic hypothesis claims that the decline in cognitive functions in dementia is predominantly related to a decrease in cholinergic neurotransmission. This hypothesis has led to great interest in the putative involvement of the cholinergic neurotransmission in learning and memory  processes (Blokland 1996; Bracco et al., 2014). 
Dopamine plays diverse roles in human behaviour and cognition but it is mainly involved in motivation, decision-making, reward processing, attention, working memory and learning (Steinberg and Janak, 2012; Labudda et al., 2010).
Noradrenaline is associated with memory processing as it induces lasting changes in the brain that could sustain memories over time (Gazarini et al., 2013). As confirmed later on its neurotransmission indeed strengthens memory-related synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation, allowing memories to be formed and maintained in a more intense and enduring manner, a notion particularly valid for those with emotional content (Jo√´ls et al. 2011). Like other types of memory, an emotional memory has to be consolidated to allow its later retrieval. Accumulating evidence has indicated that noradrenaline acts during these gradual stages to fine-tune the strength and/or persistence of a memory (Guzm√°n-Ramos et al. 2012; Gazarini et al., 2013).

Neuronal network activity is fundamental to brain function and now can be measured using in vitro and in vivo techniques such as:
1.  Two-photon imaging of cell populations in vivo that are labelled with fluorescent calcium indicators. Two-photon imaging relies on fluorescence excitation and, in general, necessitates staining of cells with fluorescent dyes. Various staining methods have been developed for in vivo calcium measurements. Single cells can be filled with membrane-impermeable calcium indicators via intracellular recording electrodes or by single-cell electroporation. The basic aspects of in vivo calcium imaging and recent developments that allow evaluation of the neural circuits activity are described by G√∂bel et al., (2007a). 
With new imaging technology, scientists are now better able to visualize neural circuits connecting brain regions in humans. Advances in genetic engineering, microscopy, and computing are enabling scientists to begin to map the connections between individual nerve cells. 
2. Optical detection of neuronal spikes both in vivo and in vitro.
Assuming action potential (AP) as the only trigger of calcium influx, spike patterns are directly reflected in the trains of calcium transients. Each fluorescence trace is the convolution of the spike train with the single AP-evoked calcium transient plus added noise. The temporal resolution will be limited by the acquisition rate of the network scanning approach. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio of fluorescence signals will be a decisive factor for the accuracy of the reconstruction. 
3. Microelectrode array (MEA) recordings in primary cultures. Glutamate analogues effects on neuronal network activity can be assessed (Lantz et al., 2014) and neuronal spontaneous activity evaluation is already used for screening purposes (Valdivia et al., 2014).
4. To understand the function of a neural circuit, it is important to discriminate its sub-network components. This is possible through counterstaining of specific neuronal and glial cell types, especially in bulk loaded tissue where markers need not be calcium sensitive. In addition, transgenic mice with fluorescent protein expression in specific neuronal subsets, allow separation of functional signals into different neuronal subtypes (G√∂bel et al., 2007b). 
5. Combined positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a new tool to study functional processes in the brain, including  the response to a stimulus simultaneously using PET. Functional MRI (fMRI), is used to assesses at the same time fast vascular and oxygenation changes during activation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combined PET-MRI for the simultaneous study of the brain at activation and rest, revealing comprehensive and complementary information to further decode brain function and brain networks (Wehrl et al., 2013). 
6. Seed-based correlative analysis of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET (FDG-PET) differences in images (resting state minus activation) is suitable to identify cerebral networks in rats. Using awake and freely moving animals enables functional network analysis of complex behavioral paradigms (Rohleder et al., 2015).
Although most experiments at present are carried out in anesthetized animals, several approaches for imaging in awake behaving animals have been devised that ultimately aim at directly correlating neuronal network dynamics with behaviour (Dombeck et al., 2007, Arenkiel et al., 2007). Finally, through expression of light-activated channel proteins, it might become possible in the future to not only read-out but also control neuronal networks in vivo (Garaschuk et al., 2006)since with the development of X-ray, CT, and MRI, deep neural networks involved in learning and memory processes can be studied in vivo (Cheng et al., .2014). 
7. NMDAR overactivation-induced LTD that decrease number of spine density can be measured in vitro using GFP technology and by cofilin-F-actin quantification (Calabrese et al., 2014). 
Current behavioural tests used  for evaluating neural network function: 
1. The Morris water maze:  this test is developed to measure spatial orientation in rats
The rat has to swim around the pool to search for a platform onto which he can escape from the water. In one condition, the platform is visible, rising 1 cm above the water surface. In a Second condition the rat has to learn to find the hidden platform provided it remains in the fixed position relative to distal room cues. 
2. Radial maze: In the T-maze version of working memory, the animal has to remember only a single item for each trial. In the radial arm version of the working memory procedure rats have to learn multiple items.
3. Passive avoidance: fear-motivated avoidance tests are usually based on electric current as source of punishment.
4. Spontaneous alternation: spontaneous alternation is spatial alternation and represents a tendency to avoid stimulus re-exposure during exploratory behaviour. T-maze (simple or multiple), Y-maze, and radial maze are used to quantify an innate, unlearned response in rats.
These four behavioural tests are described in detail in the review by Myhrer (Myhrer  et al., 2003).

	dcterms:description	"""The MIE of this AOP can be triggered by direct binding of an agonist to NMDARs or indirectly through initial activation of KA/AMPARs. Indeed, binding of agonist to KA/AMPARs results in ion influx (Na+ and a small efflux of K+) and glutamate release from excitatory synaptic vesicles causing depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron (Dingledine et al. 1999). Upon this depolarization the Mg2+ block is removed from the pore of NMDARs, allowing sodium, potassium, and importantly, calcium ions to enter into a cell. At positive potentials NMDARs then show maximal permeability (i.e., large outward currents can be observed under these circumstances). Due to the time needed for the Mg2+ removal, NMDARs activate more slowly, having a peak conductance long after the KA/AMPAR peak conductance takes place. It is important to note that NMDARs conduct currents only when Mg2+ block is relieved, glutamate is bound, and the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized. For this reason the NMDA receptors act as ‚Äúcoincidence detectors‚Äù and play a fundamental role in the establishment of Hebbian synaptic plasticity which is considered the physiological correlate of associative learning (Daoudal and Debanne, 2003; Glanzman, 2005). Post-synaptic membrane depolarization  happens almost always through activation of KA/AMPARs (Luscher and Malenka, 2012). Therefore, a MIE of this AOP is defined as binding of an agonist to these three types of ionotropic receptors (KA/AMPA and NMDA) that can result in a prolonged overactivation of NMDARs through (a) direct binding of an agonist or (b) indirect, mediated through initial KA/AMPARs activation. The excitotoxic neuronal cell death, triggered by sustained NMDARs overactivation in the hippocampus and/or cortex leads to the impaired learning and memory, defined as the adverse outcome (AO) of this AOP.

Biological state: 
L-glutamate (Glu) is a neurotransmitter with important role in the regulation of brain development and maturation processes. Two major classes of Glu receptors, ionotropic and metabotropic, have been identified. Due to its physiological and pharmacological properties, Glu activates three classes of ionotropic receptors named: Œ±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid (AMPA receptors), 2-carboxy-3-carboxymethyl-4-isopropenylpyrrolidine (kainate receptors) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA receptors, NMDARs), which transduce the postsynaptic signal. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are integral membrane proteins formed by four large subunits that compose a central ion channel pore. In case of NMDA receptors, two NR1 subunits are combined with either two NR2 (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D) subunits and less commonly are assembled together with a combination of NR2 and NR3 (A, B) subunits (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010). To be activated NMDA receptors require simultaneous binding of both glutamate to NR2 subunits and of glycine to either NR1 or NR3 subunits that provide the specific binding sites named extracellular ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Apart from LBDs, NMDA receptor subunits contain three more domains that are considered semiautonomous: 1) the extracellular amino-terminal domain that plays important role in assembly and trafficking of these receptors; 2) the transmembrane domain that is linked with LBD and contributes to the formation of the core of the ion channel and 3) the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain that influences membrane targeting, stabilization, degradation and post-translation modifications. 

Biological compartments: 
The genes of the NMDAR subunits are expressed in various tissues and are not only restricted to the nervous system. The level of expression of these receptors in neuronal and non-neuronal cells depends on: transcription, chromatin remodelling, mRNA levels, translation, stabilization of the protein, receptor assembly and trafficking, energy metabolism and numerous environmental stimuli (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010). 
In hippocampus region of the brain, NR2A and NR2B are the most abundant NR2 family subunits. NR2A-containing NMDARs are mostly expressed synaptically, while NR2B-containing NMDARs are found both synaptically and extrasynaptically (Tovar and Westbrook, 1999). 

General role in biology:
NMDA receptors, when compared to the other Glu receptors, are characterized by higher affinity for Glu, slower activation and desensitisation kinetics, higher permeability for calcium (Ca2+) and susceptibility to potential-dependent blockage by magnesium ions (Mg2+). NMDA receptors are involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). Functions of NMDA receptors:
1. They are involved in cell signalling events converting environmental stimuli to genetic changes by regulating gene transcription and epigenetic modifications in neuronal cells (Cohen and Greenberg, 2008). 
2. In NMDA receptors, the ion channel is blocked by extracellular Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions, allowing the flow of Na+ and Ca2+ ions into the cell and K+ out of the cell which is voltage-dependent. Ca2+ flux through the NMDA receptor is considered to play a critical role in pre- and post-synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism important for learning and memory (Barria and Malinow, 2002).
3. The NMDA receptors have been shown to play an essential role in the strengthening of synapses and neuronal differentiation, through long-term potentiation (LTP), and the weakening of synapses, through long-term depression (LTD). All these processes are implicated in the memory and learning function (Barria and Malinow, 2002).

1. Ex vivo: The most common assay used is the NMDA receptor (MK801 site) radioligand competition binding assay (Reynolds and Palmer, 1991; Subramaniam and McGonigle, 1991; http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/UNC-CH%20Protocol%20Book.pdf; http://www.currentprotocols.com/WileyCDA/CPUnit/refId-ph0120.html). This assay
is based on the use of the most potent and specific antagonist of this receptor, MK801 that is used to detect and differentiate agonists and antagonists (competitive and non-competitive) that bind to this specific site of the receptor. Also radioligand competition binding assay can be performed using  D, L-(E)-2-amino-4-[3H]-propyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid ([3H]-CGP 39653), a high affinity selective antagonist at the glutamate site of NMDA receptor, which is a quantitative autoradiography technique (Mugnaini et al., 1996). D-AP5, a selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that competitively inhibits the glutamate binding site of NMDA receptors, can be studied by evoked electrical activity measurements. AP5 has been widely used to study the activity of NMDA receptors particularly with regard to researching synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Evans et al.,1982; Morris, 1989). The saturation binding of radioligands are used to measure the affinity (Kd) and density (Bmax) of kainate and AMPA receptors in striatum, cortex and hippocampus (K√ºrschner et al., 1998).
2. In silico: The prediction of NMDA receptor targeting is achievable by combining database mining, molecular docking, structure-based pharmacophore searching, and chemical similarity searching methods together (Neville and Lytton, 1999; Mazumder  Borah, 2014)

	dcterms:description	"""Biological state: Iodine (I2) is a non-metallic chemical element which is required for the normal cellular metabolism. It is one of the essential components of the TH, comprising 65% and 58% of T4&#39;s and T3&#39;s weight, respectively and therefore it is crucial for the normal thyroid function. It is a trace element and a healthy human body contains 15-20 mg of iodine, most of which is concentrated in the thyroid gland (Dunn, 1998). Iodide (I-) that enters the thyroid gland remains in the free state only briefly and subsequently it bounds to the tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin to form the precursors of the thyroid hormones mono-iodinated tyrosine (MIT) or di-iodinated tyrosine (DIT) (Berson and Yalow, 1955). The bounding rate of iodide is 50-100% of the intra-thyroidal iodide pool, meaning that only a very small proportion of this element is free in the thyroid and this comes mainly by the deiodination of MIT and DIT.

The body is not able to produce or make iodine, thus the diet is the only source of this element. Iodine is found in nature in various forms, such as inorganic sodium and potassium salts (iodides and iodates), inorganic diatomic iodine and organic monoatomic iodine (Patrick, 2008). Thus, it is widely distributed in the environment but in many regions of the world the soil&#39;s iodine has been depleted due to different environmental phenomena. In these regions, the incidence of iodine deficiency is greatly increased (Ahad and Ganie, 2010).

The daily iodine intake of adult humans varies greatly due to the different dietary habits between the different regions on earth (Dunn, 1993). In any case, the ingested iodine is absorbed through the intestine and transported into the plasma to reach the thyroid gland. However, thyroid is not the only organ of the body that concentrates iodide. It has been shown that other tissues have also the ability of iodide concentration, such as the salivary glands, the gastric mucosa, the mammary glands and the choroid plexus, all of which express NIS, the iodine transporter protein (Jhiang et al., 1998; Cho et al., 2000).

Biological compartments: A sodium-iodide (Na/I) symporter pumps iodide (IO) actively into the cell, which previously has crossed the endothelium by largely unknown mechanisms. This iodide enters the follicular lumen from the cytoplasm by the transporter pendrin, in a purportedly passive manner. In the colloid, iodide (I&minus;) is oxidized to iodine (I0) by an enzyme called thyroid peroxidase (TPO). IO is very reactive and iodinates the thyroglobulin at tyrosyl residues in its protein chain. In conjugation, adjacent tyrosyl residues are paired together. Thyroglobulin binds the megalin receptor for endocytosis back into the follicular cell. Proteolysis by various proteases liberates thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine molecules (T3), which enter the bloodstream where they are bound to thyroid hormone binding proteins, thyroxin binding globulin (TBG) which accounts for about 75% of the bound hormone. The adult thyroid absorbs 60-80 &mu;g of iodide per day to maintain the thyroid homeostasis (Degroot, 1966). Inadequate amount of iodide results to deficient production of thyroid hormones, which consequently leads to an increase of TSH secretion and goiter, as compensating effect (Delange, 2000). On the other hand, excess iodide could also inhibit TH synthesis (Wolff and Chaikoff, 1948). The proposed mechanism for this latter effect is the possible formation of 2-iodohexadecanal that inhibits the generation of H2O2 and the subsequent oxidation of iodide in the thyroid follicular cells. The lack of oxidized free radicals of iodide affects the reaction with the tyrosine residues of Thyroglobulin (Tg) (Panneels et al., 1994). During pregnancy, the organism of the mother is also supporting the needs of the foetus and therefore the iodide requirements are greatly increased (Glinoer, 1997). Additionally, small iodine concentrations have been found to have significant antioxidant effects that resembles to ascorbic acid (Smyth, 2003).

General role in biology: The most important role of iodine is the formation of the thyroid hormones (T4 and T3). The thyroid actively concentrates the circulating iodide through the basolateral membrane of the thyrocytes by the sodium/iodide symporter protein (NIS). The concentrated thyroid-iodine is oxidized in the follicular cells of the gland and consequently binds to tyrosines to form mono- or di-iodotyrosines (MIT and DIT respectively), being incorporated into thyroglobulin. This newly formed iodothyroglobulin forms one of the most important constituents of the colloid material, present in the follicle of the thyroid unit. If two di-iodotyrosine molecules couple together, the result is the formation of thyroxin (T4). If a di-iodotyrosine and a mono-iodotyrosine are coupled together, the result is the formation of tri-iodothyronine (T3). From the perspective of the formation of thyroid hormone, the major coupling reaction is the di-iodotyrosine coupling to produce T4.

	mmo:0000000	"""The radioactive iodine uptake test, or RAIU test, is a type of scan used in the diagnosis of thyroid gland dysfunction (http://www.thyca.org/pap-fol/rai/; Kwee, et al., 2007). The patient swallows radioactive iodine in the form of capsule or fluid, and its absorption by the thyroid is studied after 4&ndash;6 hours and after 24 hours with the aid of a gamma scintillation counter. The percentage of RAIU 24 hours after the administration of radioiodide is the most useful, since this is the time when the thyroid gland has reached the plateau of isotope accumulation, and because it has been shown that at this time, the best separation between high, normal, and low uptake is obtained. The test does not measure hormone production and release but merely the avidity of the thyroid gland for iodide and its rate of clearance relative to the kidney.

	dcterms:description	"""Biological state

The GABA-mediated depolarizing effects at the post-synaptic neurons in early development are well documented (Ben-Ari, 2014) and have been greatly correlated with the emergence of spontaneous network activity, which is the first neuronal activity of the brain (Voigt et al., 2001; Opitz et al., 2002). This spontaneous network activity is characterized by synchronous bursts of action potentials and concomitant intracellular calcium transients in large group of cells and it has been proposed to have functional role during the synaptogenesis and the formation of connections within the neuronal network (Wang and Kriegstein, 2010; Ben Ari et al., 2007; Blankenship and Feller, 2010).

One of the milestones at the critical stage of brain development is the switch of the GABAergic signalling from depolarizing early in life to a more conventional hyperpolarizing inhibition on maturation (Ben-Ari et al., 2007). This developmental GABAergic switch is mainly driven by the expression change of the predominant potassium-chloride co-transporters (KCC2 and NKCC1) around this period that results in a shift from high to low intracellular Cl&minus; concentration at the post-synaptic neurons (Lu et al., 1999).

Biological compartments

GABAergic interneurons are a heterogeneous group of neuronal cells that consist only 10 to 20% of the total neuronal population (Aika et al., 1994; Halasy and Somogyi, 1993). They are characterized by aspiny dendrites and the release of GABA neurotransmitter, which makes them the main inhibitory source in the adult central nervous system (CNS) (Markram et al., 2004). A hallmark of interneurons is their structural and functional diversity. Many different subtypes have been identified in the cortex and hippocampus, but a global classification in specific categories is difficult to be established due to the variable morphological and functional properties (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008; DeFelipe et al., 2013). The interneurons can be primarily identified by their characteristic morphology, which would divide them into 4 basic groups: basket cells, chandelier cells, bouquet cells and bitufted cells. However, a broader classification of these cells would require at least the following criteria: 1) morphology of soma, axonal and dendritic arbors; 2) molecular markers including but not restricted to calcium binding proteins (parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin) and neuropeptides (e.g., Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide [VIP], reelin, somatostatin); 3) postsynaptic target cells; and 4) functional characteristics (Ascoli et al., 2008). They are neither motor nor sensory neurons, and also differ from projection neurons which send their signals to more distant locations.

GABAergic interneurons are broadly present throughout the CNS, although telencephalic structures, such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, show the most abundant quantities of this neurotransmitter (Jones 1987). Complex interconnections between GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal cells shape the responses of pyramidal cells to incoming inputs, prevent runaway excitation, refine cortical receptive fields, and are involved in the timing and synchronisation of network oscillations (Wehr and Zador, 2003; Markram et al., 2004; LeMaqueresse and Monyer, 2013; Hu et al., 2014).

General role in biology

Inhibitory GABAergic interneurons of the adult nervous system play a vital role in neural circuitry and activity by regulating the firing rate of target neurons (reducing neuronal excitability). In vertebrates, GABA acts at inhibitory synapses in the brain by binding to specific transmembrane receptors in the plasma membrane of both pre- and postsynaptic neuronal processes. Released neurotransmitter typically acts through postsynaptic GABAA ionotropic receptors in order to trigger a neuronal signalling pathway. This binding causes the opening of ion channels to allow the flow of either negatively charged chloride ions into the cell or positively charged potassium ions out of the cell. This action results in a negative change in the transmembrane potential, usually causing hyperpolarization.

During early brain development GABA mediates depolarisation that has recently been shown to promote excitatory synapse formation by facilitating NMDA receptor activation in cortical pyramidal neurons (Wang and Kriegstein, 2008). GABAergic signalling has the unique property of &quot;ionic plasticity&quot;, which is dependent on short-term and long-term concentration changes of Cl- and HCO3- in the postsynaptic neurons. The intracellular ion concentrations are largely modified in the course of brain development corresponding to the operation and functional modulation of ion transporters, such as the K-Cl co-transporter 2 (KCC2) and the Na-K-Cl co-transporter 1 (NKCC1) (Blaesse et al., 2009; Blankenship and Feller, 2010).

GABA plays an important role as the first excitatory transmitter during embryogenesis and it has been shown to affect neurogenesis, differentiation, migration, and integration of developing neurons into neuronal circuits (LoTurco et al., 1995; Heck, et al., 2007).

The effects of GABA being depolarizing are also important in the adult brain, as it has impact on synaptic plasticity and is strongly correlated with seizures (Baram and Hatalski, 1998; Ben-Ari et al., 2012). If GABAergic interneuron function breaks down, excitation takes over, leading to seizures and failure of higher brain functions (Westbrook, 2013)

	mmo:0000000	"""Parvalbumin (PV) is a marker of&nbsp; GABAergic interneurons that can be identified by immunohistochemistry.&nbsp; GABA or GAD can be used&nbsp; for identification and morphometric analysis of the GABAergic neuronal population (Voigt et al., 2001; De Lima et al., 2007), with the use of anti-GABA antibodies. Protein levels on interneurons can be measured by commercial available antibody sandwich ELISA kits, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence and mRNA levels is possible to be measured with RT-PCR, with the use of the primers in interest each time.

Calcium imaging experiments is the most common way to detect the depolarizing action of neurons, as this is correlated with a transient increase in intracellular calcium (Voigt et al., 2001). The local application of GABA agonist, muscimol, during the calcium imaging has been used the last decades in order to investigate the developmental effects of GABA in the post-synaptic neurons (Owens et al., 1996; Gangulu et al., 2001; Baltz et al., 2010; Westerholz et al., 2013).

	dcterms:description	"""Biological state: Sodium/Iodide symporter (NIS) is a key protein in the thyroid function and its role has been thoroughly investigated after the determination of its molecular identity a few decades ago (Dai et al., 1996). NIS is an intrinsic membrane glycoprotein and it belongs to the superfamily of sodium /solute symporters (SSS) and to the family of human transporters SLC5 (De La Vieja, 2000; Jung, 2002). Its molecular weight is 87 kDa and it contains 13 transmembrane domains tha transport 2 sodium cations (Na+) for each iodide anion (I-) into the follicular thyroid cell (Dohan et al., 2003). The regulation of NIS protein function is usually cell- and tissue-specific (Hingorani et al., 2010) and it is done at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels, including epigenetic regulation (Darrouzet et al., 2014; Russo et al., 2011a). One of the major NIS regulators is the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which has been shown to enhance NIS mRNA and protein expression, therefore it can contribute to restore and maintain iodide uptake activity (Saito et al., 1997; Kogai et al., 2000). At the posttranslational level TSH also contributes to NIS regulation but the specific mechanisms that underlie these effects are still under investigation (Riedel et al., 2001).

Biological compartments: NIS protein is mainly found at the basolateral plasma membrane of the thyroid follicular cells (Dai et al., 1996), where it actively mediates the accumulation of iodide that is the main component of thyroid hormone synthesis and therefore is considered as a major regulator of thyroid homeostasis. NIS also mediates active I- transport in extrathyroidal tissues but it is commonly agreed that is regulated and processed differently in each tissue. Functional NIS protein has been found in salivary gland ductal cells (Jhiang et al., 1998; La Perle et al., 2013), in the mammary gland during lactation (Perron et al., 2001; Cho et al., 2000), lung epithelial cells (Fragoso et la., 2004), intestinal enterocytes (Nicola et al., 2009), stomach cells (Kotani et al., 1998), placenta (Bidart et al., 2000) and testicular cells (Russo et al. 2011b). Additionally, contradictory results have been obtained regarding the NIS expression in human kidney tissue (Lacroix et al., 2001; Spitzweg et al., 2001). In the case of the lactating breast, it is suggested that NIS serves the transfer of iodide in the cells and it subsequent accumulation in the milk, thereby supplying newborns with this component during this sensitive developmental period (Tazebay et al., 2000). Additionally, NIS mRNA has been detected in various other tissues, such as colon, ovaries , uterus, and spleen (Perron et al., 2001; Spitzweg et al., 1998; Vayre et al., 1999), but the functional NIS protein and the site of its localization has not been verified.

General role in biology: The NIS is known in the field of thyroidology because of its ability to mediate the active transport of I- into the thyrocytes, which is the first and most crucial step for T3 and T4 biosynthesis (Dohan et al., 2000). NIS is located on the basolateral membrane of the thyrocytes and co-transports 2 sodium ions along with 1 iodide (2:1 stoichiometry). The electrochemical gradient of sodium serves as the driving force for iodide uptake and it is generated and maintained by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, which is located in the same membrane of the thyrocytes. The iodide molecules, after their active transport in the cytoplasm, are passively translocated in the follicular lumen via the transporter protein pendrin and possibly other unknown efflux proteins that are located on the apical membrane (Bizhanova and Kopp, 2009). Subsequently, the thyroid hormones are synthesized in the follicular lumen by incorporating the accumulated iodide, a process which is significantly suppressed in case of NIS dysfunction or inhibition (reviewed in Spitzweg and Morris, 2010). NIS is the last thyroid-related component to be expressed during development at the 10th gestational week, which temporaly coincides with the onset of thyroid function and hormonogenesis (Szinnai et al., 2007). Albeit the localization of NIS is not fully completed at this stage, the iodide accumulation has already started. Mutations of NIS gene (SLCA5A) cause expression of non-functional NIS molecule leading to inability of the thyrocyte to accumulate iodide (Matsuda and Koshugi, 1997; Pohlenz et al., 1998), a condition called iodide transport defect (ITD). This is a rear autosomic recessive disease, which if not properly treated is clinically identified by congenital hypothyroidism, goiter, low I- uptake, low saliva/plasma I- ratio and mental impairment of varying degrees (Dohan et al., 2003). Up to date 13 mutations have been described in the NIS gene (Spitzweg and Morris, 2010) and each one of them produces mutants with different structure but in all cases non-functional. The extensive study after NIS molecular characterization and the numerous findings have convinced the scientists that is one of the most crucial components of the entire thyroid system. Additionally, after the realization that NIS could be also used as diagnostic and therapeutic tool for thyroid and non-thyroid cancers (Portulano et al., 2013) a new research activity concerning this specific mechanism has been initiated.
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""There are several methods that are used nowadays to detect the functionality of NIS but none of these methods is OECD validated (OECD Scoping document, 2017). The most well established methods are the following:

1. Measurement of radioiodide uptake (125I-) in NIS expressing cells. For this method the FRTL5 cell line is the most commonly used, as it endogenously express the NIS protein, but also NIS transfected cell lines have been successfully implemented in many cases (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2007; 2008b; Lindenthal et al., 2009). Once inhibitory activity is identified for a compound then further tests are performed in order to verify that the observed effect is specific due to NIS inhibition. This method has been also adapted in a high throughput format and has been already used for the screening of a chemical library of 17.020 compounds (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008b).

2. More recently a non-radioactive method has been developed, which has been also adapted in a high throughput format (Waltz et al., 2010). It is a simple spectrophotometric assay for the determination of iodide uptake&nbsp; using&nbsp; rat thyroid-derived cells (FRTL5) based on the catalytic effect of iodide on the reduction of yellow cerium(IV) to colorless cerium(III) in the presence of arsenious acid (Sandell-Kolthoff reaction). The assay is fast, highly reproducible and equally sensitive with the radioiodine detection method.

3. A fluorescence-based method has been developed, which uses the variant&nbsp; YFP-H148Q/I152L of the Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) in order to detect the efflux of iodide into the rat FRTL5 cells. As a positive control perchlorate is used&nbsp; as it is a well known&nbsp; competitive inhibitor of iodide transport by NIS. Fluorescence of recombinant YFP-H148Q/I152L is&nbsp; suppressed by perchlorate and iodide with similar affinities. Fluorescence changes in FRTL-5 cells are&nbsp; Na+-dependent, consistent with the Na+-dependence of NIS activity.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is supposed to be an innovative approach to detect the cellular uptake of perchlorate and characterize the kinetics of transport by NIS. This method needs further optimization, as YFP is not specific for iodide and thus binding of other ionic molecules could affect the results of the assay (Cianchetta et al., 2010; Rhoden et al., 2008; Di Bernarde et al., 2011).

4. In vivo 125I uptake assays is based on&nbsp; immunofluorescence analyses of thyroid glands after the treatment of rat with excess I&minus;,&nbsp; injected with Ci Na125I&nbsp; as previously described by Ferreira et al., 2005. Then the thyroid glands are&nbsp; removed and weighed, and the amount of 125I in the thyroid gland is&nbsp; measured in a &gamma;-counter (PerkinElmer; model Wizard). The counts per minute in the thyroid gland are used to calculate the percentage of 125I in the thyroid gland, having in account that 100% corresponded to the counts per minute injected I&minus; into the rat (Arriagada et al., 2015).

5. The U.S. EPA&#39;s Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program aims to use high-throughput assays and computational toxicology models to screen and prioritize chemicals that may disrupt the thyroid signaling pathway. Thyroid hormone biosynthesis requires active iodide uptake mediated by the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS). Monovalent anions, such as the environmental contaminant perchlorate, are competitive inhibitors of NIS, yet limited information exists for more structurally diverse chemicals. A novel cell line expressing human NIS, hNIS-HEK293TEPA, was used in a radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) assay to identify inhibitors of NIS-mediated iodide uptake. The RAIU assay was optimized and performance evaluated with 12 reference chemicals comprising known NIS inhibitors and inactive compounds. An additional 39 chemicals including environmental contaminants were evaluated, with 28 inhibiting RAIU over 20% of that observed for solvent controls. Cell viability assays were performed to assess any confounding effects of cytotoxicity. RAIU and cytotoxic responses were used to calculate selectivity scores to group chemicals based on their potential to affect NIS. RAIU IC50 values were also determined for chemicals that displayed concentration-dependent inhibition of RAIU (&ge;50%) without cytotoxicity. Strong assay performance and highly reproducible results support the utilization of this approach to screen large chemical libraries for inhibitors of NIS-mediated iodide uptake (Hallinger et al., 2017).

6. This study (Wang et al., 2018) applied a previously validated high-throughput approach to screen for NIS inhibitors in the ToxCast phase I library, representing 293 important environmental chemicals. Here 310 blinded samples were screened in a tiered-approach using an initial single-concentration (100 &mu;M) radioactive-iodide uptake (RAIU) assay, followed by 169 samples further evaluated in multi-concentration (0.001 &mu;M&minus;100 &mu;M) testing in parallel RAIU and cell viability assays. A novel chemical ranking system that incorporates multi-concentration RAIU and cytotoxicity responses was also developed as a standardized method for chemical prioritization in current and future screenings. Representative chemical responses and thyroid effects of high-ranking chemicals are further discussed. This study significantly expands current knowledge of NIS inhibition potential in environmental chemicals and provides critical support to U.S. EPA&rsquo;s Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) initiative to expand coverage of thyroid molecular targets, as well as the development of thyroid adverse outcome pathways (AOPs).

	dcterms:description	"""TH signalling controls a number of major anatomical processes in development that if altered will lead to permanently abnormal brain morphology. These processes include differentiation of neurons and glia from progenitor cells, neuronal migration, and myelination of axonal processes.  The evidence supporting a role of TH in these neurodevelopmental processes is strong.  Evidence from human is primarily from studies of iodine-deficient children and children with congenital hypothyroidism (CH)(Zoeller and Rovet, 2004). Animal models using rats and mice, as well as in vitro studies, have provided ample evidence of TH control of these processes (Gilbert and Zoeller, 2010).  Below are brief descriptions of the impact of TH insufficiency on two of these processes.
Altered Neuronal Migration: Effects of TH insufficiency on specific developmental events are reflected in alterations in brain structure. Altered lamination and cellular morphology in cerebellum (Koibuchi and Chin, 2000; Morte et al., 2004; Farwell and Dubord-Tomasetti, 1999), hippocampus (Madeira et al., 1991), and the neocortex (Auso et al., 2003; Cuevas et al., 2005) have been documented. In addition presence of aberrantly placed neuronal cells in the corpus callosum have been described (Gilbert et al., 2014, Powell et al., 2012; Shibutani et al., 2009).
Altered Axonal Myelination: Nerve conduction is accelerated by the insulation formed by oligodendrocytes of the myelin sheath that surround axons of many nerve fibers. Reduced size and altered composition of the white matter tracts throughout the brain, the most prominent of which is the corpus callosusm, are hallmarks of severe developmental hypothyroidism (Berbel et al., 1993, 1994; Ferreira et al., 2004; Gravel and Hawkes, 1990; Ibarrola and Rodriguez-Pena, 1997; Schnoover et al., 2005). In addition, more subtle abnormalities have been described in white matter tracks including corpus callosum and anterior commissure following more modest reductions in circulating levels of TH in the neonatal period (Sharlin et al., 2008).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Data in support of this key event have been collected using a wide variety of standard biochemical, histological and anatomical methods (eg., morphometrics, immunohistochemical staining, in situ hybridation) and imaging procedures.  Many of methods applied to reveal anatomical abnormalities are routine neurohistopatholgical procedures similar to those recommended in EPA and OECD developmental neurotoxicity guidelines. Subtle changes in cytoarchitecure such as seen in the neocortex depend on more specialized birth dating procedures and staining techniques. Some alterations in brain structure are transient in nature and depend on appropriate timing for detection.

	dcterms:description	"""Discrete parts of nerve cells, single neurons, simple circuits, and complex brain systems have been used to evaluate the impact of thyroid disruption on brain function.  The nervous system functions as a highly integrated and organized communication and information processing network. Neurons transmit and receive information from sensory and motor organs, but the largest number of neuronal connections is with other neurons. This is largely accomplished by chemical transmission across the synaptic cleft, the space where the specialized ending of the presynaptic axon terminus of the transmitting neuron meets the specialized postsynaptic region of the neuron that is receiving that information. Activation of the presynaptic neuron to produce an action potential causes the release of neurotransmitter substances into the synaptic cleft. Most of the released neurotransmitters bind with molecules at receptors on the dendrites of the postsynaptic neuron. The chemical signal is then transduced back into an electrical impulse which travels in the receiving neuron and if of sufficient magnitude, fires the neuron, and the signal is transduced once again to a chemical signal in the next neuron along the pathway. The scale of neurophysiological techniques that can be used ranges along a broad continuum from the very small (e.g., individual ion channel fluxes) to the very large anatomical pathways (e.g., electroencephalograms) in both in vitro and in vivo preparations. 
A number of studies on TH and brain function have incorporated field potentials in the hippocampus, an area critical for certain forms of learning and memory, to probe functional integrity after TH insufficiency (e.g., Dong et al., 2005;  Gilbert and Sui, 2006; Opazo et al., 2008; Vara et al.,  2002). Field potentials have been recorded following thyroid disruption both in vivo and in vitro, at two discrete hippocampal synaptic regions, area CA1 and the dentate gyrus. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission are assessed by recording electrical field potentials (voltage changes across large populations of neurons) across a monosynaptic circuit (e.g. axons from cortical neurons that synapse on dentate gyrus granule cells) in response to electrical pulses delivered to the incoming pathway (Gilbert and Burdette, 1995).
The synapses in this region of the brain are also intensely studied as they are imbued with a capacity for use-dependent plasticity, the best studied model being long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP is a model of information acquisition (learning) and storage (memory) at the synaptic level. It is induced by applying trains of stimulus pulses at high frequencies to the incoming pathway of the monosynaptic circuit and measuring the amplitude of the induced change in synaptic responsiveness that persists for hours, and in some instances days to weeks (Malenka and Nicoll, 1999; Martinez and Derrick, 1996; Gilbert and Burdette, 1995). The induction of LTP is believed to emulate, both at the synaptic and molecular level, the coincident firing of large numbers of neurons that are engaged during a learning event. The persistence of LTP emulates the duration of the memory of that learning event.
Field potentials are recorded from slices of hippocampus taken from exposed animals, or from indwelling electrodes placed within the appropriate hippocampal field. One electrode is placed in the afferent fiber pathway (e.g., perforant path for dentate gyrus, Schaeffer collaterals for CA1 region) and a brief electrical pulse applied to stimulate these axons. A second electrode is placed in the synaptic or cell body region to record the activity evoked by the incoming pulse. Electrodes are placed visually according to established landmarks in in vitro preparations, and acccording to stereotaxic coordinates for in vivo preparations. Once accurately placed, a series of stimulus pulses at increasing stimulus current intensities are applied to the input pathway, and the response evoked in the receiving neuronal population is recorded. 
Excitatory Synaptic Transmission: Two measures, the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and the population spike are derived from the compound field potential in response to a series of single pulse stimulations applied at increasing stimulus strengths. The function described by the relationship of current strength (input) and evoked response (output), the I-O curve is the measure of excitatory synaptic transmission.
Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission: Pairs of stimulus pulses delivered in close temporal proximity is used to probe the integrity of inhibitory synaptic transmission. The response evoked by the second pulse of the pair at brief intervals (&lt;30msec) arrives during the activation of feedback inhibitory loops in the hippocampus. An alteration in the degree of suppression to the 2nd pulse of the pair reflects altered inhibitory synaptic function.
Long Term Potentiation (LTP): Synaptic plasticity in the form of LTP is assessed by delivering trains of high frequency stimulation to induce a prolonged augmentation of synaptic responsivity. Probe stimuli at mid-range stimulus strenghts are delivered before and after application of LTP-inducing trains. The degree of increase in EPSP and PS amplitude to the probe stimulus after train application, and the longevity of that induced enhancement are metrics of LTP. Additionally, contrasting I-O functions of excitatory synaptic transmission before and after (1-5 hours) LTP is induced is also a common measure of induced LTP.
Assays of this type are fit for purpose, have been well accepted in the literature, and are reproducible across laboratories.  The assay directly measures the key event of altered neurophysiological function.

&quot;Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors belong to the
cys-loop superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, responsible for
rapid neurotransmission (Karlin, 2002). In insects nAChR have signaling
roles in nervous systems and neuromuscular junctions and other cells
(Jones and Sattelle, 2010; Lindstrom, 2003). Under normal conditions
the endogenous neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh), attaches to the
ligand binding domains on the extracellular region of the pentameric
nAChR. This initiates a conformation change that promotes the influx
and efflux of calcium (Ca2+) and extracellular sodium and intracellular
potassiumions, respectively, to create the action potential necessary for
synaptic signaling (Jones and Sattelle, 2010). Activation of the nAChR,
by natural or synthetic agonists, and subsequent involvement in neurotransmission
is well established. Although the nAChR is conserved
across vertebrates and invertebrates, the diverse composition and assembly
of &alpha;-(containing two adjacent cysteine residues important in
ACh binding) and non &alpha;-(lacking the cysteine residues) subunits confer
diverse functional architecture and, therefore, toxicological responses
(Jones and Sattelle, 2010).&quot;

&quot;As eusocial insects, honey bees rely on theworker bee caste to forage
for nectar, pollen, andwater. Foraged water can be used for evaporative
cooling of the hive during warm weather (as reviewed by Jones and
Oldroyd, 2006). Nectar and pollen collected by the foragers are the
sole food source for the colony, with nectar providing carbohydrates
and pollen providing lipids, protein, vitamins, and essential minerals
(Brodschneider and Crailsheim, 2010). Upon returning to the hive, forager
bees identify non-foraging, food-storing hive bees and deliver their
collection by regurgitating nectar carried back in their honey stomach
(i.e., foregut of proventriculus; Free, 1959). The hive bees place the nectar
in wax cells for processing into honey. Hive bees also aid foragers in
unloading pollen from the pollen baskets (corbicula) on the forager&#39;s
hind legs and place it in cells where it is mixed with nectar to form
bee bread, which is stored for consumption by the colony (Winston,
1987). Foragers consume only small amounts of the food they collect.
Hive bees consume the food they receive in order to produce proteinrich
royal jelly and brood food, which they use to nourish both the
queen and the developing brood (Winston, 1987). During winter, the
colony survives on the pollen and nectar that was stored as bee bread
and honey over the spring, summer, and fall seasons (Seeley and
Visscher, 1985).
The act of foraging is a perilous and metabolically challenging task
that is typically carried out by worker bees in the later stages of life
(Woyciechowski and Moro≈Ñ, 2009). However, the timing of the role
change from hive bee to forager can vary depending on the needs of
the colony. There are environmental, hormonal, and social cues that determine
when and how often foragers search for food and fluid, includingweather,
abundance or scarcity of food resources, magnitude of food
stockpiled in the hive, health of the colony, and size of the brood
(Dreller and Tarpy, 2000). Such cues initiate physiological changes involved
in the transition of a worker bee to foraging, which include
changes to flight muscles andmetabolic rate. These changes accommodate
the reported 70-fold increase in oxygen consumption needed to
sustain physical and cognitive activities of the forager bee (Kammer
and Heinrich, 1978). It has been documented that the volume of
neuropil in mushroom bodies is increased by approximately 15%, and
the somata of the Kenyon cells decreased by approximately 29% in foragers
compared to day-old bees (Withers et al., 1995). Change in lipid
stores also occurs in forager bees prior to foraging, whereby their abdominal
lipid is reduced to approximately half that of nurse bees
(Chang et al., 2015; Toth and Robinson, 2005). Further, there is lowprotein
content in the forager&#39;s fat body cells, and vitellogenin (Vtg; egg

yolk) protein production is significantly reduced, while juvenile hormone
levels are significantly increased (Toth and Robinson, 2005). Another
change which occurs at the stage where worker bees become
foragers is that their flight muscle fiber thickness decreases and diameter
of the myofibrils, which contain the contractile filaments, increases
in preparation for prolonged flight during foraging (Correa-Fernandez
and Cruz-Landim, 2010).&quot;

&quot;Colony death/failure is defined as demise of a functional colony. Dramatic losses in the number of managed honey bee colonies have been reported across the globe (Potts et al., 2010) and efforts have been undertaken to survey and identify trends in losses over time, particularly in the US and European Union. Most recent survey results collected in the US have shown that managed honey bee colony losses are significantly higher than those deemed acceptable by beekeepers (Seitz et al., 2015). From surveying commercial (&gt;300 colonies), sideline (25&ndash;300 colonies), and small scale &lt;25 colonies) beekeepers, average annual colony losses (both
summer and winter losses) per operation in the US during 2014&ndash;2015 were 49%, compared to 18.7% that has been identified by beekeepers as an acceptable loss rate (Seitz et al., 2015). Starvation, poor over-winter survival, and weak colonies, were among the most common perceived causes of loss reported by bee keepers (Seitz et al., 2015). Commercial beekeepers, managing thousands of colonies, self-reported colony collapse disorder and pesticides as third and fourth leading reasons for colony loss, respectively (Seitz et al., 2015).&quot;

&quot;The characteristics evaluated to determine the strength/health of honey bee colonies, include adequate numbers of adult bees, presence of sealed and open brood, adequate amounts of stored pollen, nectar and sealed honey, the absence of pests and disease, and the presence of a queen that lays eggs in consistent and tight patterns, with limited eggless cells (Sagili and Burgett, 2011). If the colony is weakened by any one (or a combination) of these factors for an extended period, a critical point can be reached
that will lead to colony failure. Through honey bee population dynamics models, it has been demonstrated that loss of foragers leading to precocious foraging of young bees may restore the overall foraging capacity, but the brood rearing capacity of the colony might be reduced (Khoury et al., 2011). Further, as noted above, precocious foragers are less effective and resilient, causing the forager death rate to increase. The model predicts that sustained forager losses that reduce the force by two-thirds would place a colony at risk for failure (Khoury et al., 2011). Additionally, proper brood rearing is essential to the development of healthy adult bees.&quot;

&quot;Some neuronal nAChR subunit combinations are highly permeable
to Ca2+, which acts as a messenger relaying extracellular information
to intracellular regions and to the nucleus (Uteshev, 2012). Upon influx
of Ca2+ into neurons via nAChR, Ca2+ binds to calmodulin (CaM). This
complex either activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) to catalyze the conversion
of ATP to 3&prime;5&prime;-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),which then activates
PKA, or interacts with Ca2+-CaM kinase II (CaMKII) (e.g.,
Dajas-Bailador andWonnacott, 2004; Sweatt, 2001). Regardless of signaling
through PKA or CaMKII, both kinases activate the phosphorylation
cascade via extracellular signal-related protein kinase/mitogenactivated
protein kinase (ERK/MAPK), stimulating transcription of
cAMP response element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) mediated
genes (Impey et al., 1999). In neurons, these signaling cascades lead to
the production of proteins that direct synaptic plasticity (i.e., changes
in synaptic strength in response to signaling activity),which is essential
to learning and memory.&quot;

&quot;Like most eusocial insects, honey bees exhibit age-based division of
labor and progress from nurse to forager as they age (Seeley, 1982).
This type of age-related behavioral change termed age polyethism, is a
genomically, nutritionally, and hormonally controlled process (Ament
et al., 2010; Cheng et al., 2015). Such behavior changes in adult worker
bees occur in a predictable sequence as theymove fromcentrally located
in-hive activities including cleaning brood cells (0&ndash;5 d old), to feeding
brood, capping brood, trimming cappings, and attending the queen
(2&ndash;11 d old), to peripherally located in-hive activities, such as grooming
nest-mates, feeding nest-mates, ventilating the hive, producing wax
and shaping comb cells, receiving and storing nectar, packing pollen,
and processing nectar into honey and pollen into bee bread (11&ndash;20 d
old), to outside activities, including guarding the hive and foraging
(20+ d old) (Seeley, 1982). However, honey bees exhibit phenotypic
plasticity whereby the rate of behavioral change is highly flexible,
meaning that under different scenarios, based on colony needs, bees
will accelerate or reverse their behavioral development. For example,
to compensate for a loss of foragers, disease, or nutritional stress, bees
will initiate precocious (early behavioral development) foraging
(Cheng et al., 2015; Huang and Robinson, 1996). It is biologically plausible
that early initiation of foraging could lead to a shortage of hive bees
needed to tend to the brood, which could hinder development of the
brood. In addition, precocious foraging is correlated with shorter
lifespans. Therefore, bees that forage earlier tend to do so at the expense
of their longevity which could impact overall colony resource acquisition
and productivity (Woyciechowski and Moro≈Ñ, 2009). However,
the relationship may be complex given that with seasonal variation,
food availability, predation pressures, and adverse weather conditions
that promote greater in-hive activity, older foragers can reverse their
behavior, regenerate hypopharyngeal glands, and assume roles within
the hive (Huang and Robinson, 1996).
Behavioral plasticity is driven, in part, by juvenile hormone (JH) and
its interplay with Vtg, acting together in a feed-back loop to control the
onset of labor tasks, such as foraging (Page et al., 2012). For example,
high Vtg levels suppress JH, delaying onset of foraging behavior,whereas
high JH suppresses Vtg, causing a decrease in nursing behavior (Page
et al., 2012). Studies exploring drivers of precocious foraging, using both
treatment with a JH analog and social manipulation of a single-cohort
colony of 1 d old bees in the absence of older foragers, induced precocious
foraging, demonstrating that both hormonal and social interactions
play a role (Chang et al., 2015; Perry et al., 2015). Active foragers
produce a pheromone, ethyl oleate, which is transferred to the hive
bees during trophallaxis or oral food exchange, delaying the rate at
which bees transition to foraging. Therefore, if the number of foragers
diminishes, recruitment to foraging can be accelerated. Additionally,
allatectomy (removal of the corpora allata glands that produce JH) led
to the discovery that JH is involved in modulating the speed at which
bees develop into foragers, but not in activation of foraging itself
(Sullivan et al., 2003). However, studies using ribonucleic acid

interference (RNAi) to knockdown Vtg production have found the protein
to have a prominent role in the initiation of honey bee foraging,
causing an increase in JH titer and extreme precocious foraging (3 d
old bees) (Guidugli et al., 2005; Marco Antonio et al., 2008).
Vitellogenin is synthesized in fat body cells, released to the hemolymph
(circulation), and taken up in developing oocytes (Corona et al.,
2007). Mature honey bee queens, which lay ~1000 eggs/day, continuously
synthesize Vtg at high levels, including during periods when egg
laying ceases (Seehuus et al., 2006; Corona et al., 2007). However, in
sterile worker bees, Vtg levels have been shown to change throughout
their lives, with the highest levels observed in the long-lived winter
bees and lowest in the short-lived summer foragers (M&uuml;nch et al.,
2015). In addition to the role Vtg plays as an egg yolk protein, it has a
role in oxidative stress resistance (Corona et al., 2007; Seehuus et al.,
2006; Amdam et al., 2004).&quot;

&quot;Upon prolonged and repeated exposure to a nAChR agonist, desensitizationmay
occur.Desensitization is characterized by an initial opening
of the ion channel and ion exchange across the cell membrane followed
by rapid channel closure and inactivity, effectively inhibiting neurotransmission
(Quick and Lester, 2002). Further, inhibition of nAChR activity
from desensitization can lead to an up-regulation in nAChR
expression, termed pharmacological chaperoning (Srinivasan et al.,
2012; Flores et al., 1992; Marszalec et al., 2005). Exposure to
imidacloprid and thiamethoxam for 72 or 48 h, respectively was
shown to significantly increase transcriptional abundance of nAChR&alpha;1
subunit in the honey bee brain (Christen et al., 2016). In the
desensitized state, nAChR receptors have high affinity for the agonist
and therefore establish a blockade to subsequent agonist binding
(Ochoa et al., 1989). It has been demonstrated that recovery from
nAChR desensitization occurs (though not always complete) upon removal
of the agonist (Ochoa et al., 1989). However, the speed of recovery
is dependent on the concentration and duration of exposure to the
agonist, with longer exposures typically resulting in slower recovery
times (Quick and Lester, 2002). In fact, loss of functional nAChR channels
has been reported in neuronal cell line PC12 (rat adrenal gland
pheochromocytoma tumor) upon prolonged exposure to carbachol, a
cholinergic agonist (Simasko et al., 1986).
Phosphorylation of nAChR subunits is another factor that regulates
the rate of desensitization and subsequent recovery. Nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor subunits possess phosphorylation sites for cAMP-dependent
protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), calciumcalmodulin-
dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) and endogenous
protein tyrosine kinase (Hopfield et al., 1988; Thany et al., 2007). Evidence
suggests that phosphorylation of nAChR subunits regulate the
rate of desensitization,with the greater number of phosphotyrosines indicative
of rapid recovery from desensitization (Hopfield et al., 1988;
Thany et al., 2007).&quot;

The alpha subunit is the ion pore-forming component of the channel and is organized into four homologous domains (I- IV), each with six trans-membrane alpha helices (S1-S6).  Between the S5 and S6  segments, there is a pore loop which is a primary target for anti-epileptic drugs.   The segments between S5 and S6  in each of the four domains create extracellular pore loops.  Amino acid  changes in the poor loops within domains II and IV determine if the ion channel is sensitive to sodium or calcium ions. Anti-epileptic, anti-arrhythmic and anesthetics all may bind this same site, but their action may be voltage-specific. For example, phenytoin is an ineffective block of hyperpolarized (e.g., -100mV) sodium channels, but is  more effective at blocking progressively depolarized potentials (e.g., -80 to -30 mV).

	dcterms:description	"""In cardiomyocytes, electical depolarization occurs upon the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.5) and the rapid influx of sodium ions. This influx causes the upstroke of the action potential (phase 0 in a human EKG). NaV channels turn off rapidly, but the depolarization causes Ca and K channels to open.  Calcium channels (Cav1.2) open and allow maintenance of depolarization.  Ca2+ entry also triggers contraction of the heart muscle.  Repolarization begins as  potassium channels open and allow K+ out of cell, balancing out the Ca2+ influx  to create the plateau of the action potential (phase 2).  Potassium channels terminate the action potential and return the cell to rest (phases 3 and 4). The ether a go-go gene (ERG;KCNH2) encodes for one of the ion channel proteins (the 'rapid' delayed rectifier current (IKr)) that conducts potassium (K+) ions out of the muscle cells.  This current is critical in correctly timing the return to the resting state (repolarization) of the cell membrane during the cardiac action potential (Sanguinetti and Tristani-Firouzi, 2006).  In other species,such as zebrafish, other ion channels may be absent (Alday et al., 2014), but the ERG channel is likely highly conserved.
In humans, the ERG potassium channel's pore is composed of 4 identical alpha subunits.   Each subunit consists of 6 transmembrane alpha helices, numbered S1-S6, a pore helix situated between S5 and S6, and cytoplasmically located N- and C-termini. Arginine or lysine amino acids present in the S4 helix likely acts as the voltage-sensitive sensor. Between the S5 and S6 helices, there is an extracellular loop (known as 'the turret') and 'the pore loop', which begins and ends extracellularly but loops into the plasma membrane; the four subunit pore loops form the selectivity filter inside the pore.  
The relatively large inner vestibule of the ERG channel permits binding of many pharmaceutical agents of diverse structure and function.  The more common drugs which can result in ERG block include antiarrhythmics (especially Class 1A and Class III), anti-psychotic agents, and certain antibiotics (including quinolones and macrolides). Binding of the ERG channel and subsequent inhibition of the Ikr can result in prolonged QT syndrome, Torsade de Points or bradycardia.

	dcterms:description	"""The site of action is the tubulin in the cytoplasm. Tubulins represent a large superfamily, and several isotypes are described for both &alpha; and &beta; tubulin in mammalian cells [Luduena 2013]. At least six different isotypes of the &alpha; subunit are known, while eight isotypes are known for the &beta; subunit. These subunits share a high degree of homology (90% similarity). In addition to &alpha;- and &beta;-tubulin, other tubulin homologues have been identified (&gamma;, &delta; and &epsilon;), but their roles in the life cycle of the cell are uncertain [Bhattacharya and Cabral 2009]. All available isotypes are incorporated within microtubules, although with different tissue distributions in normal cells [Berrieman et al. 2004]. The currently known microtubule-disrupting agents bind to all isotypes, having only a slight preference for one over another [Miller et al. 2010].

Binding sites on the &alpha;/&beta;-tubulin heterodimer: Conventionally, microtubule-interfering agents are categorized into two main groups: (1) microtubule destabilizers, including colchicine and a variety of vinca alkaloids; and (2) microtubule stabilizers, including taxanes and epothilones. Most agents interact with known binding pockets of &alpha;/&beta;-tubulin; however, there are compounds that bind to tubulin on undefined sites. Three distinct sites are well characterized in the literature [Marchetti et al., submitted; Botta et al., 2009]: (1) the colchicine-binding domain at the interface between the &alpha;- and &beta;-tubulin dimers; (2) the vinca domain surrounding the GTP binding site on &beta;- and &alpha;-tubulin; and, (3) the taxane domain located on &beta;-tubulin [Botta et al. 2009].

Colchicine binding domain on tubulin: The colchicine binding domain is a deep pocket located at the &alpha;/&beta; interface of tubulin heterodimers. Crystal structures for tubulin and different ligands are available, although their resolution is not high [Lu et al. 2012; Massarotti et al. 2012]. Notwithstanding its deep location, significant conformational changes in the protein are necessary for accommodating the inhibitors. Both the A and C rings of colchicine are necessary for high affinity binding, while the B ring may only function as a linker between the other two. Three methoxy residues are present in the A ring and all of them are involved in the high affinity binding to tubulin. The C ring of colchicine interacts through van der Waals contacts with Val&alpha;181, Ser&alpha;178, and Val&beta;315. The carbonyl group behaves as a hydrogen bond acceptor, interacting with Val181a. The A ring is buried in a hydrophobic pocket delimited by Lys&beta;352, Asn&beta;350, Leu&beta;378, Ala&beta;316, Leu&beta;255, Lys&beta;254, Ala&beta;250, and Leu&beta;242, and the methoxy group at position 3 is involved in a hydrogen bond interaction within the thiol group of Cys&beta;241 [Marchetti et al., submitted]. Different ligands may compete with colchicine for the same binding site, even in the absence of high structural correspondence [Lu et al. 2012].
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""&nbsp;

Binding properties to tubulin are generally evaluated in vitro, typically on tubulin extracts derived from brain tissues [Miller and Wilson 2010]. To determine whether a compound can bind to tubulin, a competitive [3H]colchicine tubulin-binding assay is conducted in vitro to measure whether the binding of colchicine is inhibited by the presence of the test agent [Verdier-Pinard et al. 1998]. A reaction mixture containing tubulin, [3H]colchicine and a potential inhibitor is incubated and after the addition of the scintillation fluid, the radioactivity of [3H]colchicine-bound tubulin is measured using a scintillation counter. The reduction of [3H]colchicine-bound tubulin value is inversely proportional to the test agent binding affinity [Hamel and Lin 1981]. A reaction mixture with only tubulin and [3H]colchicine is generally used as an experimental control standard. The inhibition constant (Ki) of colchicine is 5.75 &mu;M [Zavala et al. 1980] and the ability of new chemicals to interfere with colchicine binding to tubulin is benchmarked against this value.

Microtubules are dynamic structures characterized by features such as dynamic instability and treadmilling. Dynamic instability defines the ability of microtubules to grow or shorten; the process is based on a multitude of events regulating the assembly/disassembly of the subunits. Treadmilling is the process by which, in the presence of an active loss of subunits (at the minus end) and acquisition of subunits (at the plus end), a steady-state is maintained and the length of the microtubule remains unchanged. Colchicine interferes with microtubule dynamics at lower concentrations while it induces a net depolymerization at higher concentrations which is a consequence of the inability of further extending the microtubules [Stanton et al. 2011]. This dual action is in common with other spindle poisons (e.g. vinca derivatives) [Panda et al. 1996]. All microtubule-binding agents alter microtubule dynamics, engaging cell cycle surveillance mechanisms that arrest cell division in metaphase. This mitotic stall may then lead to various irremediable effects such as mitotic catastrophe, apoptosis or aneuploidy [Kops et al. 2005].

Microtubule depolymerization is generally assessed by an in vitro tubulin polymerization assay [Salmon et al. 1984; Wilson et al. 1984; Ibanez et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2010]. A reaction mixture containing tubulin and a test agent, after preincubation, is chilled on ice. GTP is added, and turbidity development is followed at 350 nm in a temperature controlled recording spectrophotometer. The extent of the reaction is then measured and the area under the curve is used to determine the concentration that inhibited tubulin polymerization by 50% (IC50) [Hamel 2003]. A concentration of 2.5 ŒºM of colchicine is needed to inhibit microtubule polymerization by 50% [Zavala et al. 1980] and the ability of new chemicals to induce this effect is benchmarked against this value (e.g., combretastatin A-4 IC50 is 1.2 ŒºM [Pettit et al. 1998]).

Occytes:

In mammalian oocytes, centrioles are absent [Manandhar et al. 2005] and the meiotic spindle starts its growth from several Microtubule-Organizing Centers (MTOCs) that substitute for the conventional centrosome pair. These MTOCs gradually coalesce and surround the chromosomes [Schuh and Ellenberg 2007]. Then, microtubules elongate forming a barrel-shape bipolar spindle. Recent data suggest that MTOCs undergo a three-step decondensation and fragmentation process that facilitate their equal distribution to the spindle poles [Clift and Schuh, 2015] and that human oocytes may lack MTOCs and that spindle assembly is mediated by chromosomes and the small guanosine triphosphate Ran [Holubcov√° et al., 2015]. The major abnormalities which can be recorded are: reduction of microtubule density, loss of barrel shape, monopolar or multipolar spindle, reduced distance between the poles [Ibanez et al. 2003; Shen et al. 2005; Eichenlaub-Ritter et al. 2007; Xu et al. 2012].

Localization of proteins with a known role in spindle function is also assessed [Tong et al. 2002; Yao et al. 2004; Cao et al. 2005]. 3D live imaging of cells expressing fluorescent-tagged proteins provides the possibility to follow spindle function at high resolution, and to describe and measure abnormal parameters (e.g., spindle morphology, altered distance between the two poles, mono- or multipolarity) [Schuh and Ellenberg 2007].

	dcterms:description	"""An aneuploid offspring is an organism born with an incorrect number of chromosomes (which is present in all of their cells) [reviewed in Marchetti et al. 2015].
In most cases, the aneuploid condition will result in the death of the conceptus at different stages of embryo-fetal development depending on the chromosome involved in the aneuploidy. When aneuploid fetuses survive to birth, they will originate offspring affected by aneuploid syndromes, characterized by variable symptoms depending on the specific chromosome involved. The health consequences of a trisomic condition are well established in both humans and mice. Each of the 19 autosomal trisomies of the mouse has been produced and the survival and phenotype of each trisomy characterized [Epstein 1988]. Growth retardation is almost invariably present and congenital malformations are frequently detected. Trisomic fetuses generally survive until at least mid gestation. However, with the exception of trisomy 19 and to a lesser extent trisomy 16 and 18, all die prior to parturition. The precise cause of death of the trisomic embryos is not known. In some instances it appears to be related to extremely poor embryonic growth and development. Aneuploid mouse zygotes are karyotypically unstable during preimplantation development leading to a state of chaotic mosaic aneuploidy within the blastocyst [Lightfoot et al. 2006]. In contrast to the survival of trisomic embryos and fetuses until at least mid gestation, mouse autosomal monosomies are lethal in the pre- or peri-implantation period, with only rare survivors until day 6 of gestation [Magnuson et al. 1985]. Due to dosage compensation mechanisms, aneuploidies of the sex chromosomes in the mouse are viable [Russell 1976]. 
Survival data of aneuploidies in humans generally match those in mice: aneuploidies of the sex chromosomes are viable, all autosomal monosomies and most trisomies die before birth, with the exception of trisomy 13, 18 and 21 that, in some cases, survive until shortly after birth or much longer (as in the case of Down syndrome). Even in the case of trisomy 21, the most viable of the human trisomies, an estimated 80% or more fetuses die in utero [Hecht and Hecht 1987]. Aneuploid conditions compatible with life present a range of adverse health effects from infertility (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome due to XXY karyotype) to severe mental and physical impairment and reduced life span (e.g., Edwards Syndrome due to trisomy 18).

	dcterms:description	"""The majority of work for this key event has been conducted in mouse oocytes in vitro. The key event is altered chromosome dynamics at metaphase/anaphase transition. Normal chromosome dynamics refers to the proper alignment and separation of the chromosomes at metaphase and anaphase, respectively. Altered chromosome dynamics refers to the incorrect separation of chromosomes involving an abnormal spindle and a defective cell cycle checkpoint [reviewed in Marchetti et al. 2015].
In oocytes, the meiotic cell division is characterized by unique features with respect to the mitotic process, including: (1) the process by which the meiotic spindle is formed; (2) chromosome organization in bivalents (homologous pairs) with sister kinetochores acting as a functional unit; (3) the role of homologous recombination to ensure proper biorientation and stability of the bivalent structure; (4) the direct entry of oocytes into the second meiotic division, following the first anaphase; and, (5) the lack of chromatin decondensation and formation of the nuclear membrane.

Altered chromosome dynamics at metaphase/anaphase is generally assessed by confocal microscopy on fixed or live cells [Shen et al. 2005; Eichenlaub-Ritter et al. 2007; Schuh and Ellenberg 2007]. Antibodies against centromeric proteins and multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are useful approaches to follow chromosome congression: for example, distances between kinetochores and spindle midzone are used to evaluate the dynamics of chromosome congression; interkinetochore distances may be measured to verify a correct biorientation [Shen et al. 2005; Eichenlaub-Ritter et al. 2007; Schuh and Ellenberg 2007; McGuinness et al. 2009; Lane et al. 2012].

""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""
Aneuploidy (i.e., altered chromosome number) is assessed by standard cytogenetic methods that entail the preparation of meiotic or mitotic metaphases to count the number of chromosomes present. Standard methods for assessment in somatic cells have been described [INSERT REFERENCES]. There are OECD guidelines for cytogenetic analysis of chromosome abnormalities in somatic cells [OECD TG 473 and 475); however, the detection of aneuploidy is not standardized using these approaches. Aneugens are detected by the micronucleus assay [OECD TG 474 and 487], but these methods are not specific to only aneugens. Integration of centromere-specific probes in micronucleus assays enables assessment of aneugenicity using these approaches (Zijno et al. 1996].  

Methods for handling either single oocytes [Tarkowski 1966] or multiple oocytes [Mailhes and Yuan 1987a] are available. Metaphases are then analyzed under a microscope to count the number of chromosomes. To improve the accuracy of counting, identification of the centromeres can be done using traditional C-banding [Salamanca and Armendares 1974] or fluorescent immunostaining [Leland et al. 2009]. In these studies, the analyzed endpoint is the chromosome number in either second meiotic metaphases or zygotic metaphases. According to a conservative approach, evidence of aneuploidy induction is provided by a statistically significant increase of hyperhaploid metaphases because it cannot be excluded that some hypohaploid metaphases may result from technical artifacts. However, chromosome nondisjunction is expected to produce equal numbers of hyper- or hypohaploid oocytes. Thus, to estimate the total frequency of aneuploid oocytes induced by this mechanism, the frequency of hyperhaploid metaphases is generally doubled. Even this calculation may lead to an underestimate of the absolute aneugenic effect because mechanisms other than nondisjunction, such as chromosome lagging, may produce an excess of hypohaploidies. Indeed, an excess of colchicine-induced hypohaploid oocytes has been reported [Sugawara and Mikamo 1980]. 
Aneugenicity can also be measured using a C. elegans screening platform for rapid assessment [Allard et al. 2013].  This methodology fluorescently marks aneuploid eggs and embryos.

	dcterms:description	"""The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR; NR1I3) is a nuclear receptor that is expressed primarily in the liver (and to a lesser extent in kidneys, intestines and stomach),&nbsp;which can be activated by xenobiotics or by certain endogenous cellular metabolites. CAR normally is tethered in the cytoplasm via a set of specific proteins including heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and other chaperones. Chemical ligands bind to the ligand binding site of CAR, and a conformational change frees CAR from the tethering proteins and facilitates its transport into the nucleus. In addition, indirect CAR activators (e.g. phenobarbital) can bind to the EGF receptor to initiate a series of steps that eventually dephosphorylate a critical Threonine-38 residue in CAR, allowing it to migrate into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, CAR dimerizes with RXR&alpha; and this CAR-RXR complex binds to specific response elements on the DNA to activate transcription of specific CAR-responsive genes. CAR is unique among nuclear receptors, in that it is constitutively active when in the nucleus, i.e. it will spontaneously dimerize with RXR and alter gene expression, even without an activator bound to its ligand binding domain. When activated and translocated to the nucleus, CAR alters the transcription of multiple genes, and it is the altered levels of these gene transcripts (i.e. mRNA levels) that produce the downstream biological effects following activation of CAR (Omiecinski et al., 2011b;&nbsp; Omiecinski et al., 2011a;&nbsp; Reschly and Krasowski, 2006;&nbsp; Swales and Negishi, 2004).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Activation of CAR by a chemical substance is often detected in an in vitro system, using a reporter construct that is transiently transfected into a model cell line. The reporter readouts are typically luminescent (e.g. luciferase-based) (Omiecinski et al., 2011b;&nbsp; Stanley et al., 2006). Because CAR is constitutively active, many traditional reporter assay approaches can be confounded due to high background activity when the cytoplasmic tethering complex for CAR is inadequate in the cell&nbsp;line being used. Omiecinski et al. (2011b) were able to develop a successful reporter assay for CAR from mouse, rat, human and dogs by inserting a 5 amino acid&nbsp;modification into the different species&#39; CAR, in conjunction with a luciferase reporter construct driven by a human CYP2B6 response element. This system showed strong responses to model CAR activators that were selective for each species&#39; CAR, which is an important consideration since the ability of a particular chemical to activate&nbsp;the CAR receptor is very species-specific&nbsp;(Omiecinski et al., 2011b). &nbsp;Other groups have used a similar strategy to develop sensitive reporter assays by inserting a single amino acid residue into human CAR&nbsp;(Chen et al., 2010).

With in vivo testing, activation of CAR by a chemical substance is most readily detected by indirect methods, considering the complex set of processes that are involved. Typically, expression of a small subset of genes in a tissue of interest (e.g. liver) that are known to be regulated by CAR can be measured via RT-PCR methods (reverse transcripase - polymerase chain reaction), or for the whole animal transcriptome by microarrays or RNAseq methodologies (Currie et al., 2014;&nbsp; Peffer et al., 2018a;&nbsp; Peffer et al., 2018b). In these experiments, treatment of animals for 7 or 14 days and comparison of the response in control vs. treated tissue is assessed;&nbsp; CAR-responsive genes in mice&nbsp;might include Cyp2b10, Gadd45b, Ki67, Cyp2c55 and Gstm3 (Oshida et al., 2015a;&nbsp; Peffer et al., 2018a;&nbsp; Tojima et al., 2012), but an appropriate set of genes for the species and strain being tested would need to be devised based on the literature. Oshida et al. (2015a) have developed a CAR signature&nbsp; in mice that represents the combined change in an 83-gene signature derived from multiple CAR activating compounds given to groups of mice&nbsp;for 30 days. A compound&#39;s response&nbsp;compared to the CAR signature can be compared for both the direction and magnitude of all 83 genes, and a statistically significant match evaluated via Correlation Engine (Illumina). &nbsp;When a known CAR activator (Peffer et al.;&nbsp; Tamura et al., 2013)&nbsp;that was not part of the training set was tested&nbsp;and evaluated, it also&nbsp;gave a&nbsp;clear&nbsp;statistically significant confirmation&nbsp;as a CAR activator&nbsp;(Peffer et al., 2018b).&nbsp;

A more generic in vivo measurement approach that may be applicable in&nbsp;a wider array of&nbsp;species, is to look&nbsp;for increases in &nbsp;enzyme activity or protein levels for CAR-responsive enzymes, such as CYP2B or CYP3A&nbsp;induction (Burke et al., 1985;&nbsp; Burke et al., 1994;&nbsp; Sun et al., 2006). While this approach gives some evidence that the chemical tested is a CAR activator, it must be recognized that other nuclear receptors can also induce&nbsp;the same enzymes to varying&nbsp;extents, so evidence by these methods&nbsp;is suggestive of CAR activation&nbsp;but&nbsp;not definitive. More definitive evidence that a substance is a CAR activator, can be attained in vivo by&nbsp;experiments in CAR null mice or rats, which lack the gene for the CAR molecule. Absence of&nbsp;responses in CAR null mice or rats for the gene expression, CYP2B enzyme induction,&nbsp; liver hepatocellular hypertrophy and increases in liver&nbsp;weight, and presence of these responses in treated wild-type animals, is a&nbsp;convincing proof that these effects were mediated by activation of CAR in the wild-type animals.

&nbsp;

Uroporphyrinogen III is the first cyclic metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of heme. Under normal conditions, it is converted into coproporphyrinogen III by the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), and subsequently processed to heme following three further steps[1]. In the event that UROD activity is reduced (due to genetic disorders or chemical inhibition) uroporphyrinogen III, and other porphyrinogen substrates of UROD, are oxidized to highly stable porphyrins, which accumulation and lead to a heme disorder known as porphyria (Figure 1)[2].

Figure 1: Disruption of the normal heme biosynthesis pathway by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) inhibition. Formation of the inhibitor (suggested as being uroporphomethene) is thought to require the action of the phase I metabolizing enzyme, CYP1A2. Synergistic induction of ALA synthase 1 and increases in oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), caused by alcohol, estrogens and xenobiotics, potentiate the accumulation of porphyrins and therefore the porphyric phenotype. (Modified from Caballes (2012) Liver Int. 32 (6), 880-893.)



&nbsp;

Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) is the fifth enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway and catalyzes the step-wise conversion of uroporphyrinogen to coproporphyrinogen. Each of the four acetic acid substituents is decarboxylated in sequence with the consequent formation of hepta-, hexa-, and pentacarboxylic porphyrinogens as intermediates[1]. Impairment of this enzyme, either due to heterozygous mutations in the UROD gene or chemical inhibition of the UROD protein, leads to accumulation of uroporphyrins (and other highly carboxylated porphyrins)[2], which are normally only present in trace amounts.

Due to the high instability of porphyrinogens, they must be synthesized as an integral part of the enzyme assay for use as a substrate. Uroporphyrinogen can either be generated by enzymatic synthesis or chemical reduction[7]. The former makes use of bacterial porphobilinogen deaminase to prepare the porphyrinogen substrate and the latter often utilizes sodium amalgam or sodium borohydride under an inert gas. Chemical reduction however often involves large quantities of mercury or extremely alkaline conditions and requires significant purification before the enzyme assay can be performed. Bergonia and colleagues[8] suggest palladium on carbon (Pd/C) to be the most efficient and environmentally friendly chemical preparation of porphyrinogens as Pd/C is more stable than sodium amalgam and can easily be removed by filtration, eliminating the need for laborious purification.

Once uroporphyrinogen is synthesized it is co-incubated with UROD under standardized conditions. The reaction is then stopped, reaction products and un-metabolized substrate are esterified, and the porphyrin esters are separated and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography[7]. This enzyme assay classically utilizes milliliter quantities but has been modified to a microassay, minimizing cost and enhancing sensitivity[9].

Another method based on reverse-phase HPLC was developed[15]. This assay system uses either uroporphyrinogen III or pentacarboxyporphyrinogen I as substrate and liver homogenate in sucrose treated with a suspension of cellulose phosphate as enzyme source.

Porphyria is a disorder in which the disturbance of heme biosynthesis results in accumulation and excretion of porphyrins[1]. A variety of porphyrias exist depending on which enzyme in the pathway is deficient (Figure 1). In the case of chemically induced urporphyria, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), which converts uroporphyrinogen to coproporphyrinogen, is inhibited. In humans, this disorder is known as porphyria cutanea tarda and may be caused by chemical exposure or a hereditary deficiency in UROD[4]. The accumulation of porphyrins in the liver causes cirrhosis, mild fatty infiltration, patchy focal necrosis, and inflammation of portal tracts. When the activity of UROD is reduced to less than 30% of normal, the disorder manifests as an overt skin disease; the accumulation of porphyrins in the skin causes photosensitization that is characterized by fragile skin, superficial erosions, sub-epidermal bullae, hypertrichosis, patchy pigmentation and scarring[5].

The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. The protein encoded by this gene localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and its expression is induced by some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), some of which are found in cigarette smoke. The enzyme&#39;s endogenous substrate is unknown; however, it is able to metabolize some PAHs to carcinogenic intermediates. Other xenobiotic substrates for this enzyme include caffeine, aflatoxin B1, and acetaminophen. [4]

The CYP1A subfamily of enzymes is very well studied and is often used as a biomarker of Dioxin-like compound (DLC) exposure and toxicity[5][6][7][8]. CYP1A5 is the avian isoform and is orthologous to the mammalian CYP1A2[9]. CYP1A5 is expressed in avian heart, liver and kidney tissues[10][11], and has been measured in avian hepatocyte and cardiomyocyte cultures[12][13][10][14]. Mouse CYP1A2 is only constitutively expressed in the liver, but is inducible in the liver, lung, and duodenum[20].

Enzyme activity

There are a number of substrates that are preferentially metabolized by Cyp1A2 and CYP1A5 allowing for CYP1A activity to be measured as a function metabolite formation. Methoxyresorufin O-demethylation (MROD) is a classic marker of Cyp1A2/5 activity[21] and is often used due to the ease of fluorometric techniques; however, Burke et al.[21] suggest that a ratio of MROD to ethoxyresorufin O-demethylation (EROD) is a better measure of CYP1A2 activity due to the contribution of CYP1A1 to MROD. CYP1A2/5 activity can also be measured as the metabolic rate of arachidonic acid[11], oroporphyrinogen[22], acetanilide 4-hydroxylase and caffeine[23]. Caffeine metabolism has been used in clinical studies as a biomarker for CYP1A2 activity in humans[24].

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR)

Levels of CYP1A2/5 messenger RNA can be measured using QPCR. This technique monitors the amplification of a targeted gene during PCR as accumulative fluorescence [25]. For example, Head and Kennedy[26] developed a multiplex QPCR assay utilizing dual-labeled fluorescent probes to measure CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 mRNA levels simultaneously from samples already analyzed for EROD activity. QPCR has high throughput capability and a low detection limit relative to other methods.

Luciferase reporter gene (LRG) assay

An LRG assay can be used to measure AHR1-mediated transactivation of a target gene. This assay is particularly useful as it can measures CYP1A4/5 induction exclusively caused by activation of the AHR, through which many DLCs exert their toxic effects. This assay is easily modified to measure AHR1-mediated transactivation in various species, simply by transfecting the desired AHR cDNA clone and reporter gene construct (containing the appropriate reporter gene) into the chosen cell line. This has been demonstrated to be an efficient high throughput method in various avian and mammalian studies.[27][28][29]

Cryopreserved human HepaRG&reg; or cryopreserved human primary hepatocytes are incubated in presence of a potential CYP1A2 inducer and the identity and abundance of CYP1A2 product is evaluated using analytical HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). HPLC is applied for concentration and purification of the product to be&nbsp;detected, whereas MS is applied for its specific quantification&nbsp;[31].

Inhibition potency is reported as the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and may be determined from dose response curves (the concentration of inhibitor required to inhibit the maximal transporter activity by 50%) or may be estimated from the activity with and without the inhibitor (V and V0) and the concentration of the inhibitor (I):
V = V0/ [1+(I/IC50)^n] where n is the slope of the relationship between uptake rate in the presence and absence of the inhibitor.
Naidoo and Swan (2009) estimated inhibition by plating chicken or vulture renal tubule cells on culture inserts, incubating with the inhibitory drug (diclofenac or meloxicam) and adding para amino hippuric acid (PAH).

Inflammation is a crucial link that is related to many of these conditions, with the potential for the development of cirrhosis or primary liver cancer which represent the end-stage of liver pathology and are often associated with mortality: chronic hepatitis (A-E), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) [1]. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) still is a major problem in drug development as its early detection is problematic, and acute liver inflammation is the most common symptom. DILI is the main cause for withdrawal of drugs from the pharmaceutical market [2].
Liver inflammation is marked by an increased influx of neutrophils, following the secretion of signaling factors such as CXC chemokines and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) from damaged cells [3]. Kupffer cells (KCs), the resident macrophages of the liver and accounting for about 15-20% of total cell numbers in a healthy liver. They are the gatekeepers in the liver, as they monitor the blood that enters this organ [4][5]. Activation of KCs by activation of toll like receptors, for example, leads to the recruitment of further inflammatory cells as well as amplified KC activation. This, in turn, activates Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) [5] which can link liver inflammation to further severe outcomes such as development of fibrosis
A list of drugs generally known to induce DILI can be found here [6].

	dcterms:description	"""Lysosomes were first described by de Duve and colleagues in 1955 [1]. They are acidic, single-membrane bound organelles that are present in all eukaryotic cells and are filled with more than 50 acid hydrolases to serve their purpose of degrading macromolecules [2].
Lysosomes are the terminal organelle of the endocytic pathway, but are also involved in membrane repair and other cellular processes, such as immune responses [3]. The amount of lysosomal enzymes that are released into the cytosol regulates the cell death pathway which is initiated by lysosomal damage: it plays a vital role in the induction of apoptosis, whereas massive lysosomal rupture leads to necrosis [4]  [5]. Lysosomes are known to be involved in external as well as internal apoptotic pathways. The external pathway triggers lysosomal destabilization by hydroxyl radicals, p53, caspase 8,through activation of Bax or by ceramide which is converted into sphingosine [6]. The internal apoptotic pathway on the contrary is activated through mitochondrial damage, for example via activation of Bax or Bid, phospholipases, or lysosomal enzymes [6].
The lysosome contains redox-active labile irons which are suggested to be involved in local ROS production via a Fenton-type reaction [7]. It has been shown that lysosomal membrane disruption induced by lysosomotropic detergents causes early induction of lysosomal cathepsin B and D and induction of ferritin, together with an increase of cellular ROS and concomitant reduction of the antioxidants MnSOD (manganese superoxide dismutase) and GSH (glutathione), possibly due to the release of free iron into the cytosol [8] [9]. Released enzymes such as phospholipases can further damage the outer membrane of the mitochondrion, leading to a further increased and uncontrolled ROS production, the release of cytochrome c, the activation of the caspase cascade, and subsequent apoptotic cell death [10].
Considering nanomaterials (NMs) as a trigger for lysosomal damage, recent studies underpinned the importance of lysosomal NM uptake for NM-induced toxicity. Once the material is taken up by a cell and transported to the lysosome by autophagy, the acidic milieu herein can either enhance solubility of a NM, or the material remains in its initial nano form. Both situations can induce toxicity, causing lysosomal swelling, followed by lysosomal disruption and the release of pro-apoptotic proteins [11] [12] [13].
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Lysosomes are typically analysed microscopically.
Changes in morphology can be observed by using acridine orange (AO), a weak base that accumulates in the acidic compartment of the cell mainly composed of lysosomes. Red fluorescence is exhibited when it is highly concentrated in acidic vesicles, while green fluorescence is exhibited when it's less concentrated in other parts of the cell [14] [15] [16]. 
Lysotracker green (200 nM) is regularly used to assess lysosomal acidification; Anguissola and colleagues reported that it was excited through a 475+/240 nm band pass filter and fluorescence emission was collected through a 515+/220 nm band pass filter. Analysis is performed using microscopical methods such as High Content Analysis [17]. This method as well as use of LysoSensor probes has been reported repeatedly elsewhere, for example [9] [16].
More specific staining can be achieved by staining with antibodies against lysosomal membrane proteins [16].
Lysosomal membrane permeabilization can be visualized by immunostaining of lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin B [18].

	dcterms:description	"""TNF-induced cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, GMCSF, CXCL1, and RANTES, can instigate and amplify immune responses through triggering the production of acute phase proteins and the recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages, and basophils to the site of inflammation, and by triggering increased production of monocytes/macrophages from bone marrow[1]. Monocytes are the precursors of macrophages and dendritic cells and circulate in the blood for 1-3 days. Upon secretion of chemokines such as CCL2 which is also referred to as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), they can migrate towards affected tissue. This was nicely demonstrated when depletion of MCP-1 in supernatants of Fas-stimulated cells was sufficient to block almost all THP-1 monocyte chemotaxis. Using an in vivo mouse model, the authors found that Fas stimulation could trigger phagocyte migration by administration of anti-Fas (Jo2) antibody into C57BL/6 mice within 10 h of anti-Fas administration. This correlated with extensive cell death in the thymus and a dramatic increase of CD11b-positive macrophages in the same tissue[1].
Neutrophils, on the other hand, account for about 50 70&#160;% of all blood leukocytes in the human body [2][3]. Upon an inflammatory event, neutrophil production is upregulated, and its lifetime increases as a response to platelet activating factor (PAF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or various pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1√ü (IL-1√ü) [3]. The crucial role of PMN in the human immune system is long known. In 1968, Baehner and Karnovsky described a link between a reduced PMN activity and the development of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) [4]. The important peroxidase-mediated bactericidal role of PMN and the formation of superoxide radicals as one of the main bactericial mechanisms was already described more than 30 years ago [5][6]. A strong negative correlation between the chemotactic ability of PMN and patients with increased bacterial sepsis was demonstrated [7], and clinical morbidity from infections is clearly increased with a reduced number of circulating PMN in the blood [8].
The neutrophilic cytosol contains granules that are filled with a variety of proteins, such as defensins, bactericidal-permeability-increasing protein, proteases (e.g. elastase, cathepsins), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) that consumes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and generates hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the most bactericidal oxidant that is produced by PMN [8][2]. Activated neutrophils are capable of producing a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. IL-1√ü, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23, and transport internalised pathogens to lymph nodes to support macrophages and dendritic cells in antigen presentation[9]. Also, contact with pathogens results not only in phagocytosis, but also in the so-called oxidative burst, marked by an increased consumption of molecular oxygen and resulting production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [10].
Deregulation of this response by constant stimulation of PMNs, as could be shown for nanoparticles for example, ultimately leads to the establishment of a (chronic) inflammation. Here, also macrophages play a vital role. Resident alveolar macrophages, such as Kupffer cells in the liver, that usually phagocyte microorgansims or particles will be activated when overwhelmed by the amount of invading pathogens and in turn release inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Consequently, neutrophils are recruited and activated as described above [11][12].

After a certain time period, the number of migrated cells towards the lower chamber can be determined by staining of the cells[1].

Airway epithelial injury can be caused&nbsp;by various inhalation exposures (e.g. cigarette smoke, sulphur dioxide, endotoxin, viruses). Subsequent&nbsp;tissue repair processes are thought to initiate the transdifferentiation process, whereby ciliated epithelial cells&nbsp;first dedifferentiate and then redifferentiate to goblet cells, without an apparent increase in the total number of epithelial cells&nbsp;(Lumsden et al., 1984; Shimizu et al., 1996; Reader et al., 2003).

Alternatively, transdifferentiation may occur following the activation of EGFR-mediated anti-apoptotic signaling in ciliated epithelial cells. Subsequent stimulation by proinflammatory stimuli such as the Th2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 then promotes transdifferentiation of ciliated cells into goblet cells, thereby increasing the number of goblet cells (&ldquo;second hit hypothesis&rdquo;) in mouse tracheal epithelium and airway epithelia&nbsp;of COPD patients (Laoukili et al., 2001; Tyner et al., 2006; Curran &amp; Cohn, 2010).

It also is not in agreement with other studies, which show that ciliated cells do not give rise to goblet cells during airway remodeling in rodents and humans, and with studies that provide evidence for increased goblet cell proliferation (Lumsden et al., 1984; Casalino-Matsuda et al., 2006; Hays et al., 2006; Tesfaigzi et al., 2004; Taniguchi et al., 2011).

Goblet cells are mucin-producing columnar epithelial cells, and their secretory granules can be identified easily by light or electron microscopy (Rogers, 1994).

Transdifferentiation&nbsp;in the airway epithelium is difficult to quantify. In live animals, lineage tracing studies in models of asthma or respiratory infection provided evidence that transdifferentiation occurs (Tyner et al., 2006; Gomperts et al., 2007; Turner et al., 2011). An&nbsp;experienced pathologist may assign a score that reflects the extent of airway remodeling in animal and human lung tissues, but no standard exists, and the results are at best semi-quantitative and study-specific. Some investigators view the appearance of cells bearing morphological characteristics of both ciliated and goblet cells, and co-localization of ciliated and goblet cell markers in situ, as sufficient evidence for transdifferentiation (Gomperts et al., 2007; Rogers, 1994).

It can arise from sustained proliferation of this cell population following airway injury by, for example, exposure to allergens, pathogens, cigarette smoke and other inhalation exposures (Miyabara et al., 1998; Nagao et al., 2003; Saetta et al., 2000; van Hove et al., 2009; Walter et al., 2002; Hao et al., 2014; Lukacs et al., 2010; Hao et al., 2013; Yageta et al., 2014; Nie et al., 2012; Hegab et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2016).

Following EGFR activation, classical downstream activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, also known as Raf/Ras/MAPK/ERK pathway, increases airway epithelial cell proliferation (Lemjabbar et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2005; Hackel et al., 1999) and facilitates epithelial wound repair (Burgel &amp; Nadel, 2004; Van Winkle et al., 1997; Allahverdian et al., 2010). While there is evidence that increased goblet cell proliferation may be the underlying cause of goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH; Silva et al., 2012), the key players mediating an increase in airway goblet cell numbers following EGFR activation are still largely unexplored. Basal epithelial cells which exhibit stem cell-like properties have been postulated to function as a source of goblet cells in injured airways, utilizing cell fate pathways that favor secretory cells over other cell populations (Rock et al., 2009).&nbsp; However, both in vitro studies and studies in mouse models of asthma, COPD, and viral infection indicate that transdifferentiation of ciliated or club cells into goblet cells, which is referred to as goblet cell metaplasia (GCM), more likely contributes to the expansion of this cell population in the airways (Tyner et al., 2006; Lumsden et al., 1984; Reader et al., 2003; Turner et al., 2011; Evans et al., 2004; Lamb et al., 1968; Shimizu et al., 1998).

Under normal conditions, apoptosis for example serves to eliminate damaged or infected cells and enable wound repair and resolution of inflammation (Elmore, 2007). In the airways, apoptosis occurs following exposure to cigarette smoke (Mebratu et al., 2011, Ning et al., 2013; Valencia-Gattas et al., 2016), hydrogen peroxide (Goldkorn et al., 1998), ozone (Triantaphyllopoulos et al., 2011); endotoxin (Tesfaigzi et al., 2000); infectious agents (Rajan et al., 2000; Monick et al., 2005) and ovalbumin sensitization (Truong-Tran et al., 2002; Reader et al., 2003; Takeyama et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2017).

	dcterms:description	"""The EGF receptor family comprises 4 members, EGFR (also referred to as ErbB1/HER1), ErbB2/Neu/HER2, ErbB3/HER3 and ErbB4/HER4, all of which are transmembrane glycoproteins with an extracellular ligand binding site and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Receptor-ligand binding induces dimerization and internalization, subsequently leading to activation of the receptor through autophosphorylation (Higashiyama et al., 2008).

EGFR signaling is central to airway epithelial maintenance and mucin production (Burgel and Nadel, 2004), and EGFR expression has been demonstrated in lung epithelial cells under physiological (albeit weakly) as well as pathological conditions in vitro and in vivo (Aida et al., 1994; Burgel and Nadel, 2008; O&rsquo;Donnell et al., 2004; Polosa et al., 1999). Of note, lung epithelial EGFR phosphorylation (i.e., activation) was increased under conditions of oxidative stress including exposure to H2O2 (Goldkorn et al., 1998), naphthalene (Van Winkle et al., 1997), cigarette smoke (de Boer et al., 2006; Marina≈ü et al., 2011) and in the presence of neutrophils or neutrophil elastase (Kohri et al., 2002; Shao et al., 2004; Shao and Nadel, 2005; Shim et al., 2001; Takeyama et al., 2000). EGFR activation by oxidative stress may have a number of root causes: ROS were shown to increase production of EGF, the prime EGFR ligand, by lung epithelial cells (Casalino-Matsuda et al., 2004). Similarly, expression and secretion of TGF-&alpha; and AREG, also EGFR ligands, were elevated in human bronchial epithelial cells in response to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), diesel particulate matter and cigarette smoke exposure (Blanchet et al., 2004; Lemjabbar et al., 2003; Rumelhard et al., 2007). Mechanistically, this process is dependent on ROS-mediated activation of metalloproteinases or ADAMs which cleave membrane-bound EGFR ligand precursors, making them locally available to bind to and transactivate EGFR in an autocrine manner (Deshmukh et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2004b; Val et al., 2012; Yoshisue and Hasegawa, 2004). Furthermore, ligand binding to EGFR itself was shown to lead to H2O2 production, thereby facilitating receptor activation and downstream signaling (DeYulia et al., 2005; DeYulia&nbsp;and C&aacute;rcamo, 2005; Truong and Carroll, 2012). While it is tempting to speculate that the increase in H2O2 would perpetuate EGFR activation via the continuous proteolytic shedding of pro-ligands in an autocrine loop, multiple lines of evidence suggest that oxidative modification, specifically EGFR sulfenylation, contributes to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and downstream signaling (Paulsen et al., 2011; Ravid et al., 2002; Truong and Carroll, 2012; Truong et al., 2016).

Classical EGFR downstream signaling involves activation of Ras which subsequently initiates signal transduction through the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway. MAP kinase activation in turn promotes airway epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation (Hackel et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2005; Lemjabbar et al., 2003) and facilitates epithelial wound repair (Allahverdian et al., 2010; Burgel and Nadel, 2004; Van Winkle et al., 1997).

Moreover, the addition of EGFR inhibitors such as AG1478 and BIBX 1522 or neutralizing antibodies is well suited to demonstrate causality.

For in vivo studies and clinical samples, an experienced&nbsp;pathologist may judge the presence and severity of mucin production on histological tissue sections stained with hematoxylin/eosin and Alcian&nbsp;blue and/or periodic acid Schiff stains. A grading or scoring system may enable semi-quantitative assessment, but remains subjective at best since corresponding standards are currently lacking.

	dcterms:description	"""S-glutathionylation is a redox-dependent, reversible post-translational modification that is involved in the regulation of various regulatory, structural, and metabolic proteins (Pastore and Piemonte, 2013). Under oxidative stress, S-glutathionylation targets cysteine residues of a protein and adds glutathione through thiol-disulfide exchange with oxidized glutathione (GSSG) or reaction of oxidant-induced protein thiyl radicals with reduced glutathione (Chen et al., 2010, 2011, Schuppe et al. 1992). Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) regulates vascular function by generating nitric oxide which is involved in endothelium-dependent relaxation, and control of blood pressure and vascular tone. It has been shown that cysteine residues are important for the maintenance of normal eNOS function. Under oxidative stress, S-glutathionylation of eNOS was induced by GSSG at residue sites Cys 689 and Cys 908, resulting in a decrease in eNOS activity and an increase in superoxide generation, also known as eNOS uncoupling. Furthermore, eNOS S-glutathionylation was shown to be abundant in the vessel walls of spontaneously hypertension rats (SHRs), in contrast to non-hypertensive rats. &nbsp;&nbsp;SHRs demonstrated impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, which was reversible upon administration of the reducing agent,&nbsp;dithiothreitol (Chen et al. 2010). &nbsp;Similarly in human aortic endothial cells, exposure to ultrafine particles caused a decrease in NO production in a dose-depedent manner. &nbsp;This was shown to be prevented upon over-expression of glutaredoxin-1, which inhibits eNOS S-glutathionylation (Du et al. 2013).

Fluorescence can be measured by fluorometric analysis with or without prior HPLC separation. This method allows for quantification of glutathionylated proteins but cannot detect glutathione adducts on specific proteins.
	Labeling of Glutathione: Use 35S-cysteine radiolabeling or biotin labeling to detect glutathione adducts on S-thiolated proteins.
	Use of Anti-Glutathione Antibodies: Use commercially available anti-glutathione to detect glutathionylated proteins by Western blots, immunoprecipitation or immunocytolocalization. This method is useful for analysis of individual proteins like eNOS but not for large-scale detection of glutathionylated proteins.
	Top-Down Proteomic Approach: Use liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry to identify S-glutathionylated proteins on whole protein extract from cells without using labeling or anti-glutathione antibody.

BH4 also stabilizes dimers of NOS isoforms, which is required for their enzymatic activity. When BH4 levels are decreased or limited, for example under oxidative stress conditions, BH4 can be oxidized to dihydrobiopterin (BH2) and then converted to biopterin. This reduction in BH4 availability results in NOS uncoupling where NOS is uncoupled from L-arginine oxidation and superoxide (or other reactive species) is produced rather than nitric oxide (Carnicer et al., 2012).

	dcterms:description	"""The key event that initiates this AOP (i.e. the MIE) is binding of a xenobiotic to the thyroxine (T4)-binding site of transthyretin (TTR), displacing T4 from the binding site(s) of TTR and adding this to the pool of free T4 in serum, which is normally roughly 0.02% (20 pM) of total T4 (100 nM) [in CSF, free T4 is roughly 1.4% (70 pM) of total T4 (2-3 nM)](Schweizer and Kohrle 2013).

TTR has been found to bind with a number of ligands, including pharmacologic agents as well as flavonoids and halogenated aromatic compounds, with differing strengths with some xenobiotics found to be possessing a binding affinity equal to or stronger than T4 (i.e. &quot;competitive binder&quot;). &nbsp;Studies with other xenobiotics with similar structural characteristics have found that a higher degree of halogen substitution, as well as placement on the ring relative to the hydroxyl group, increases binding affinity (Chauhan et al. 2000, Lans et al. 1993, Lans et al. 1994, Ren and Guo 2012, van den Berg 1990, van den Berg et al. 1991, Weiss et al 2015). Weiss et al (2015) compiled a database of almost 150 compounds found to bind to TTR and 52 of these were found to have higher affinity than T4 and thus, could be considered competitive binders in serum.

The function of the serum protein TTR is to deliver T4 to target cells in the liver, tight junctions, etc. where it is facilitated across the membrane via specific receptors and converted to the active form T3, where it can activate nuclear receptors. TTR facilitates passage across key tight junctions, such as the blood-brain barrier, the CSF barrier and transplacentally, and the interruption of thyroid serum protein-assisted transport during certain developmental windows can lead to profound developmental neurotoxicity (i.e. cretinism). &nbsp;It should be noted, though, that in mammals with all three functional serum transport proteins (TTR, albumin and TBG), substantial reductions in total T4 can be observed with little to no adverse effect due to overall redundancy of this system. In this scenario, roughly 75% of serum T4 is bound to TBG, 15% to TTR and up to 5% for to albumin (OECD DRP 2012). &nbsp;That being said, TTR is the sole transport protein in the CSF and T4 is not biosynthesized by the fetus until the second trimester - thus, the mother is the sole source of T4 for the fetus during early gestation and this appears to be the developmental window of greatest concern to human physiology (for example, see Loubiere et al 2010).

Transthyretin is a 55-kDa tetramer protein composed of two identical monomer subunits, each of which is formed by two four-stranded beta sheets, which are assembled around the central channel of the protein (Blake et al. 1978). This central channel contains two identical binding sites; however, there is a 100-fold difference in binding constants between the first and second T4 molecule bound and this &quot;negative cooperativity&quot; results in a 1:1 relationship between T4 and TTR in terms of protein transport in serum (Ferguson et al. 1975). The phenolic hydroxyl and iodine substitutions on the phenolic ring of T4 are important structural characteristics that differentiate ability to bind to TTR, as opposed to other serum binding proteins like TBG (Andrea et al. 1980). T4 binds to TTR in one of two ways: &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;reverse&quot; mode. In forward mode, the phenolic ring of T4 is buried deeply in the TTR binding site while this ring interacts with residues at the entrance of the binding channel in reverse mode (Lans et al 1993). Detailed structural analysis of the protein is available from X-ray crystallography (Rerat and Schwick 1967; Blake et al 1977).

There are three main in vitro approaches to measuring binding affinity between TTR and its ligands: radioligand-binding assays (RLBAs), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and fluorescence displacement. Biochemical (in chemico) approaches using GC/MS or LC/MS also exist that use recombinant (rTTR) and display limits of detection in the low nM range, including a multi-mode, ultra-high-performance LC method and anon-radioactive label, [13C6]-T4 (Aqai et al 2012).

Van den Berg et al (1991) used an in vitro competitive radioligand binding assay with gel-filtration procedure modified from Somack et al &nbsp;(1982) as well to screen 65 compounds from 12 chemical classes for evidence of interference with the T4 binding site of TTR using a radioligand binding assay and reported results semi-quantitatively, while previous work using the same method on chlorinated phenols found that affinity rose with degree of chlorination (pentachlorophenol displayed an IC50 of 2.3&nbsp;x 108 M; derived Ka = 1.2 x 108 M-1) versus the natural ligand (T4; 4&nbsp;x 108 M)(Van Den Berg, 1990). &nbsp;

Lans et al (1993, 1994) used purified TTR and T4 [125I] as a displaceable radioligand and gel-filtration procedure modified from Somack et al (1982) to study hydroxylated PCBs PCDDs and PCDFs and found many competitive binders in all classes; again, dependent on&nbsp;degree of chlorination, presence and placement of hydroxyl atom relative to chlorine placement (IC50 in 6.5-25 nM range; Ka = 0.78-3.95 x 108 M-1) versus the natural ligand (T4, Ka = 2.05&nbsp;x 107&nbsp;M-1). &nbsp;Meerts et al (2000) studied PBDEs and related compounds (pentabromophenol, Tetrabromobisphenol A) and found multiple competitive binders (IC50 range 7.7 - 67 nM; Ka = 4.3 - 38 x 107&nbsp;M-1) versus the natural ligand (T4; IC50 = 80.7 nM; Ka = 3.5&nbsp;x 107&nbsp;M-1).

Cao et al (2010) used a novel fluorescence displacement method using a protein-binding probe that fluoresces when bound, and the intensity of which dips following displacement for a ligand. Analyte titration curves are used to derive IC50 and binding constant values. They used an ANSA probe to screen 14 hydroxylated PBDEs and found competitive binding with TTR (Ka = 1.4 x 107&nbsp;M-1&nbsp;to 6.9 x 108 M-1). Molecular docking analysis revealed a ligand-binding channel in TTR for OH-PBDE binding. Ren and Guo (2012) reported use of a non-radioactive, fluorescin-T4 conjugate designed as a fluorescent probe (vs ANSA probe which is less TTR-specific) to study the binding interaction of multiple hydroxylated PBDEs with differing degrees of bromination and differing hydroxy positions and TTR. &nbsp; Competitive binders were found (IC50 range = 110-219 nM) relative to the natural ligand (T4; IC50 = 260 nM) and Kd values for the competitive binders ranged from 101-210 nM versus T4 (Kd = 239 nM). Weiss et al (2009) initially determined the competitive binding of TTR with PFCs via radioligand-binding assay of Hamers et al (2006) and Lans et al (1993). &nbsp;Ren et al (2016) used a fluorescence displacement assay to study 16 PFCs and found T4 to have an IC50 of 31 nM (Kd = 5 nM), as compared to PFOS (the strongest binder) TC50 of 130 nM (Kd = 20 nM).

The radioligand methods have been criticized for use of hazardous and costly radio-labeled material and physical separation of bound and free T4-[125I] is required. &nbsp;Marchesini et al (2006, 2008) reported a surface plasmon resonance biosensor-based method using rTTR, a surface-based measurement which may not fully characterize the binding reaction of a homogenous solution or matrix. Optimized SPR is more sensitive, amenable to high-throughput screening and easier to perform than RLBAs. &nbsp;Furthermore, hydroxy-metabolites do not endure destructive clean-up/extraction methods and differences in physicochemical qualities from parent compounds complicates separation.

Montano et al (2012) introduced a new method (using a modified&nbsp;method of Murk et al 1994 for in vitro bioactivation of PCBs and PBDEs with an ANSA-TTR displacement assay) to selectively extract metabolites (and limit co-extraction of interferants, like free fatty acids) and derive an IC50 dose-response curve for OH-PBDEs, OH-PCBs, etc. using bioactivated parent compound in a 96-well plate system. &nbsp;IC50 for the natural ligand (T4) was 0.26 uM while the IC50s for the hydroxy metabolites ranged from 0.23-0.63 uM.

	dcterms:description	"""Despite the two binding sites for T4 on the TTR serum binding protein, each molecule of TTR only carries a single T4 molecule due to the negative cooperativity displayed by these binding sites (Ferguson et al 1975). As such, xenobiotics and pharmacologic agents can displace T4 from TTR and early on, this was demonstrated for ethnacrynic acid, salicylates, penicillin and 2,4-dinitrophenol (Munro et al 1989). More recently, work with the flavonoid EMD 21388 (and other compounds structurally similar to thyroxine) showed competitive binding and displacement of T4 from the TTR carrier protein.

Rickenbacher et al (1986) provided initial direct evidence of competition for the T4 binding site using molecular modeling and binding assays using radiolabeled TH. Brouwer and van den Berg (1986) reported preferential binding of a metabolite of radiolabeled tetrachlorobiphenyl to TTR in rats (15 mg/kg, ip), using gel electrophoresis followed by HPLC analysis. Van den Berg (1990) used a competitive binding assay to assess the ability of hydroxylated chlorinated aromatic compounds to bind to radiolabeled T4. Van den Berg et al (1991) extended this work to 65 compounds from 12 different chemical groups in rats treated via a single ip dose and competitive binding assay. Chlorophenols were found to have higher affinity relative to other chlorinated aromatics, particular at higher levels of chlorination, and the combination of hydroxyl chlorine atoms in the ortho position. {insert Figure 2/Van den Berg 1990}

Kohrle et al (1989) showed complete displacement (via gel electrophoresis) of radiolabeled T3 and T4 by EMD 21388 in pooled rat serum followed by increase in the percent free TH as measured by equilibrium dialysis. Complete inhibition occurred at 10 umol and displaced T4 from TTR to serum albumin and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), which normally serve a lesser role in thyroid hormone transport in humans. {insert Figure 2}

Kohrle et al (1989) administered EMD 21388 via ip route to rats at 2 umol/100 g BW and observed displacement of radiolabeled T3 and T4 from TTR followed by a decrease of T3 and T4 in serum while the percent free TH remained unchanged. {insert Figures 3-5}

Lueprasitsakul et al (1990) repeated this protocol and found that inhibition of binding occurred within 3 minutes followed by a decrease in serum T4 concentration and an increase in both serum percent free T4 as well serum total T4. {insert Figures 1 and 4}

Mendel et al (1992) demonstrated in rats dosed via IP with EMD 21388 (2 &mu;mol/100 g BW) both displacement of radiolabeled T4 from TTR (as assessed via electrophoresis of serum proteins) and susbsequent increase of free T4 in serum.

To initially evaluate the impact of EMD 21388 on maternal/fetal hormones, Pedraza et al (1996) administered 2.5 mg 21388/day subcutaneously in pregnant female rats which led to displacement of T4 from TTR, reduced total T4 and increased free T4 in maternal circulation.

&nbsp;

Compounds that have been found to compete with TTR for binding to T4 (and thus lead to some degree of thyroid disruption) include pharmaceuticals and environmental contaminants, such as halogenated aromatic compounds.&nbsp; This latter category include PCBs, PBBs, PBDEs and perfluoro compounds and specifically, hydroxylated metabolites of all these compounds often display greater binding affinity than the natural ligand; however, this is a function of degree of halogenation as well as orientation of the halogens and hydroxyl functional group.

Gutshall et al 1989 treated male Wistar rats with a single IP dose of perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and 125I and then measured TH, uptake of 125I, liver enzymes and binding of [125I]-T4 to albumin.&nbsp; The authors did not observe increased conversion of T4 to rT3 but did note that PFDA displaced [125I]-T4 from rat albumin with an affinity similar to T4.&nbsp; While this study involved albumin, it showed that perfluoro compounds may also have potential to interact with thyroid serum transport proteins.

Meerts et al 2000 investigated the affinity of several polybrominated flame retardants (including 17 PBDE congeners) to TTR using human TTR in an in vitro competitive binding assay and [125I]-T4. Pentabromophenol and tetrabromobisphenol A were found to have affinities 7-10 fold that of T4; however, a microsomal enzyme mediated transformation was needed first (i.e. hydroxylation) for PBDEs.&nbsp; It should be noted that no reference OH-PBDEs were available at the time of this experiment.&nbsp; Like the PCB congeners, degree of bromination is a driver of binding potency as is the nature of the halogen substitution (as well as hydroxy substitution).&nbsp; In addition, brominated analogs are more potent in general relative to chlorinated ones.&nbsp; Hydroxylation of parent compound via CYP2B enzymes appears to be a prerequisite of binding to TTR.

Hallgren et al 2001 treated female Sprague Dawley rats and C57BL/6 mice daily with Aroclor 1254, PCB-105, Bromkal 70-5 DE (commercial PBDE mixture) or BDE-47 via gavage for 14 days and measured TH, induction of microsomal phase I enzymes (EROD, MROD, PROD) and UDP UGT activity.&nbsp; Free and total T4 was decreased in both species with no significant change to TSH and minimal impact on UDP UGT activity.&nbsp; Rats were found to be more sensitive than mice to the observed effects.&nbsp; The findings suggested that PBDEs may be metabolized by CYP2B, but also CYP1A to an extent, and that these induced enzymes increased the availability of hydroxylated metabolites in vivo and increase binding to T4 transport proteins.&nbsp;

Hallgren and Darnerud 2002 treated female Sprague Dawley rats with BDE-47, Aroclor 1254 and Witaclor 171P, alone or in combinations, daily via gastric intubation for 14 days. Microsomal enzyme (cytochrome P450 isozymes and UDP UGTs), ex vivo binding of [125I]-T4 to plasma proteins and light microscopy morphology of the thyroid was examined. Aroclor 1254 and BDE-47 was observed to decrease T4, decrease [125I]-T4 binding to TTR, induce several phase I enzymes as well as moderate elevation of UDP UGT activity.&nbsp; These data suggested that decreased plasma T4 is mainly due to interference with serum transport binding of parent and metabolites to TTR; however, there was clearly some role for glucuronidation in reducing T4 in this study. (PCB mixtures have been demonstrated to impact a number of different endpoints affecting normal thyroid homeostasis.)

Metabolites of BDE 47 formed by CYP2B6 include hydroxylated BDE 47 in addition to other hydroxylated congeners (Erratico et al 2013, Feo et al 2013) and it should be noted that CYP2B6 is also expressed in brain which has implications for formation of hydroxylates in that tissue (Miksys and Tyndale 2004).

Cao et al 2004 performed molecular docking analysis on the TTR and OH-PBDE interactions and confirmed the effect of degree of bromination.

Darnerud et al 2006 treated female Sprague Dawley rats with BDE 47 or Bromkal 70-5 DE at 2 doses via gavage daily for 2 weeks.&nbsp; Thyroid hormones were measured from plasma via radioimmunoassay and samples pooled for analysis for individual congeners (BDEs 28, 47, 66, 99, 100, 138, 153, 154) and internal plasma doses were calculated that corresponded with decreased free T4. This critical dose was estimated to be ~ 400 ug/g lipid BDE 47 based on significant reduction of free T4.

Hamers et al 2006, 2008 collectively found that OH-PBDEs act as agonists or antagonists at TH receptors, that OH-PBDEs with high affinity for T4 can be detected in human serum and all metabolites were found to be more potent than the natural ligand in vitro using rat liver microsomes (3-OH-BDE-47 was found to have the highest potency).

Lau et al 2007 and Chang et al 2008 reported that PFOS alters serum T4 via interference with binding proteins, leading to a transient increase in free T4 and decrease in TSH.

Weiss et al 2009 were the first to examine the potential of 24 perfluorinated compounds and 6 structurally-related fatty acids to compete with T4 for TTR via [125I]-T4 binding assay and HPLC-MS/MS analysis.&nbsp; From this analysis, 56 chemical descriptors to evaluate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of binding potency of perfluorinated compounds to TTR.&nbsp; Binding potency was found to strengthen with degree of fluorination, with maximum potency found at a chain length of eight (8) carbons; however, in general, the perfluorinated compounds were found to have T4 binding potency at about 10% that of the natural ligand.

Cao et al 2010 looked at binding interactions for 14 OH-PBDEs with TTR and TBG using fluorescence probe &amp; competitive binding assay, circular dichroism (spectroscopic measurement of a protein&rsquo;s secondary structure) and molecular docking analyses.&nbsp; Binding constant data was generated for the first time and affinity was observed to increase with degree of bromination, until a peak at the 5- and 6-brominated diphenyl ethers was reached.&nbsp; CD analysis showed that the OH-PDBEs bind to TTR and TBG at the same sites as the natural ligand while the molecular docking studies revealed a ligand-binding channel in TTR that was mostly hydrophobic inside but characterized by a positive-charged Lys15 residue at the channel entrance. The novel binding constant allowed meaningful quantitative evaluation of competitive displacement, by assuming human serum levels reported in the literature (Athanasiadou et al 2008; Marchesini et al 2008) and choosing the congener with the highest potency (5-OH-BDE47).&nbsp; This evaluation suggested that competitive displacement would be insignificant, as serum levels of protein-bound 5-OH-BDE47 are at least two orders of magnitude lower than protein-bound T4 (suggesting ~10% T4 displacement by 5-OH-BDE47).

Cao et al 2011 generated binding constant data for the interactions of BPA and TH for TTR, TBG and human albumin via fluorescence probe, noting that concentrations of BPA commonly reported in human plasma are likely not high enough to interfere with T4 transport in serum.&nbsp; A large excess of TTR and albumin in plasma are found relative to T4 and BPA and there is no competition for binding, which is further supported by the fact that affinity of BPA for T4 is much weaker than the natural ligand (by 2-3 orders of magnitude).

Ren and Guo 2012 designed a fluorescin T4 conjugate for use as a fluorescence probe in binding assays to examine interaction between eleven OH-PBDEs and transport proteins TTR and TBG. 3-OH-BDE47 and 3&rsquo;-OH-BDE154 were found to be competitive with T4.

Ren et al 2013&nbsp; higher brominated OH-PBDEs act as antagonists (i.e. BDEs 154 and 188) while lesser bromination (i.e. BDEs 47) found to be agonists

Grimm et al 2013 used fluorescence probe displacement and molecular docking simulations to characterize the binding of sulfated PCB metabolites to TTR, and stability and reversibility of these complexes were characterized by HPLC. The hydroxylated PCB metabolites (OH-PCBs) are excellent substrates for sulfation (phase II conjugation) via sulfotransferases (SULTs) and thus could represent another mechanism through which clearance can occur. Of the five lower-chlorinated sulfates for which Kd values were generated and compared against T4, only one would be considered a competitive inhibitor (4&rsquo;PCB 11 sulfate) and the only case where the sulfate displays higher affinity than its corresponding OH metabolite (4&rsquo; OH-PCB 11).&nbsp;&nbsp; Molecular docking simulation confirmed the affinity that PCB sulfates have for TTR, confirming previous reports showing higher affinity among those congeners with meta- and para-chlorination.&nbsp; These data demonstrate the toxicological relevance of PCB sulfates to TTR-mediated transport of thyroid hormones in serum for the first time.&nbsp; The generation of sulfates from OH-PCBs could be another mechanism through which PCBs may disrupt thyroid homeostasis.

Weiss et al 2015 compiled a database of 250 compounds and mixtures (including 33 never tested before), of which 144 were TTR binders and 36% (n=52) of these were found to be more potent than the natural ligand T4. The vast majority of these 52 (n=48) were aromatic, halogenated and hydroxylated. A subset of 220 compounds was further analyzed via PCA and a set of chemical descriptors to understand the chemical characteristics of TTR binders and four significant components were found to explain 85% of the variance.

Zhang et al 2015 developed a QSAR model and applied to a database of almost 500 dust contaminants taken from literature data and over 400 in silico derived metabolites, predicting 37 contaminants and 230 metabolites as potential TTR binders.&nbsp; Twenty-three (23) contaminants were than analyzed via radioligand binding assay which identified four novel TTR ligands that were then analyzed via molecular docking studies.&nbsp;

In humans, approximately 0.03% of total serum T4 is present in unbound/free condition (Refetoff et al 1970). Of the bound T4, approximately 75% is bound to TBG, approximately 20% to TTR and the remainder to ALB and some high density lipoprotein carriers. ALB is present at roughly 100-fold the molar concentration of TTR and roughly 2,000-fold higher than TBG; however, the affinity of T4 to TBG is 50-fold higher than TTR and 7,000-fold higher than ALB (Refetoff 2015). TTR binds roughly 80% of the T4 circulating in ventricular CSF although it constitutes only 25% of protein found there (Herbert et al 1986). In serum, only about 0.5% of circulating TTR is bound to T4, average serum concentration is 25 mg/dL (which can bind up to 300 ug T4/dL (Refetoff 2015).

TTR can be measured by densitometry after its separation from other serum proteins via electrophoresis, hormone saturation and/or immunoassays (Refetoff 2015).

Total T4 is most often measured using human serum based diagnostic kits, but free T4 (and T3) is only directly measured through equilibrium dialysis and ultrafiltration (Midgley 2001). Large volumes of serum must be used due to the very low concentrations of free T4 normally found (0.1% of total T4), which requires pooling of samples taken from fetus or pup. Some researchers have tried to &ldquo;micronize&rdquo; this process through combining RIA to measure total TH and dialysis to estimate the free fraction (Zoeller et al 2007).&nbsp; Extracted materials can also be quantified by HPLC. The reference range for free T4 is 9.8 to 18.8 pM/L (Dirinck et al 2016).

T3 is found in similar plasma concentrations to T4 (i.e. 5-10 pM) with &lt; 0.4% being in the unbound state. Measuring free serum T3 is labor intensive and requires equipment not available in many clinical reference laboratories and thus ultrafiltration is often used (Abdalla and Bianco 2014). Immunoassays and MS/MS are also used.

Measuring displacement of T4 from serum transport proteins is done mainly via one of three in vitro methods: radioligand binding assay, plasmon resonance-based biosensor, or fluorescence displacement.

Radioligand binding assays, using [125I]-T4 as a label, were developed to demonstrate affinity for xenobiotics to human or rat TTR and TBG (Brouwer and van den Berg 1986, Lans et al 1994). &nbsp;The most commonly used method was first published by Somack et al 1982 and adapted by Hamers et al 2006, Lans et al 1993 and Ucan-Marin et al 2010. Similar assays have been developed using [125I]-T3 as a label for affinity to chicken and bullfrog TTR (Yamauchi et al 2003).&nbsp; Radioligand methods suffer from having to use heavily regulated isotopes and lower throughput to provide free T4 measurements (due to the extra wash/separation procedure needed). The most well-known protocol uses TTR purified from human serum (which may not be as stable as recombinant) and performed in a pure aqueous solution, which may not be as stable for lipophilic compounds (Chauhan et al 2000 is an example using PCBs).

Purkey et al 2001 published a binding assay using polyclonal TTR antibodies covalently bound to sepharose resin which is then mixed with plasma pre-treated with compound of interest, washed and analyzed via HPLC.

Marchesini et al 2006 reported on the development of two surface plasmon resonance(SPR)-based biosensor assays using recombinant TTR and TBG, validated with known thyroid disruptors and structurally related compounds including halogenated phenols, polychlorinated biphenyls, bisphenols and a hydroxylated PCB metabolite (4-OH-CB 14).&nbsp; TH is covalently bound to a gold-layered chip and a mixture of the compound of interest and transport protein are injected in a flow cell passing over the bound TH.&nbsp; The authors found that these biosensor methods were more sensitive (IC50 of 8.6 &plusmn; 0.7 nM for rTTR), easier to perform and more rapid that radioligand binding assays and immunoprecipitation-HPLC.

Marchesini et al 2008 applied their biosensor-based screen to 62 chemicals of public health concern and found that hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs (particularly para-hydroxylated ones) and PBDEs (BDEs 47, 49 and 99) displayed the most potent binding to TBG and TTR, confirming many other previous studies.&nbsp; The authors conclude their optimized assays are suitable for high-throughput screening for potential thyroid disruption.

Cao et al 2010, Cao et al 2011 and Ren and Guo 2012 developed the FLU-TTR, based on a protein-binding fluorescent probe (ANSA, or 8-anilo-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid ammonium salt) that becomes highly fluorescent after binding to T4. When the compound of interest is introduced and displaces the ANSA-thyroxine probe, this fluorescence is reduced.&nbsp; This allows generation of binding constant (K) data as opposed to past efforts that generated IC50 values.&nbsp; Cao et al 2011 developed a fluorescent microtiter method for pTTR and TBG tested with bisphenol A.

Montano et al 2012 developed a competitive T4-TTR fluorescence displacement assay in a 96-well format, modified from the original method (Nilsson and Petersen 1975) and using a new selective method to extract hydroxylated metabolites while reducing fatty acid interference (modified from Hovander et al 2000).

Aqai et al 2012 described a rapid and isotope-free (13C6-T4) screening of thyroid transport protein ligands, using a competitive binding assay for rTTR using fast ultrahigh performance LC-electrospray ionization triple-quadrupole MS. The method involves the use of immunomagnetic beads followed by screening with flow cytometry and UPLC-MS. The high-throughput screening mode is capable of detecting T4 in water at the part-per-trillion level and in the part-per-billion level in urine.

Relevant Phase II enzymes that are responsible for TH metabolism include UGT1A1, UGT1A6 and SULT2A1 while relevant cellular import/export transport proteins include MCT8, OATP1A4 and MRP2. All contribute towards systemic clearance of TH and conjugates from serum whether increasing biliary excretion or moving TH into tissues and across the placenta and BBB.&nbsp; Enzyme induction can only be measured via in vitro cell-based assays and since these enzymes are all controlled by specific nuclear receptors, assays targeting these receptors might act as surrogate measurement (Murk et al 2013). Several methods measuring expression of UGT or SULT mRNA have been published; however, there have been limited efforts to develop higher-throughput methods.&nbsp; The EPA ToxCast Phase I efforts used quantitative nuclease protection assays (qNPA) to screen several hundred chemicals for UGT1A1 and SULT2A1 (Rotroff et al 2010, Sinz et al 2006).

	dcterms:description	"""Following displacement of T4 from its binding site on TTR by some competitive ligand (like EMD 21388, etc.), the T4 joins the small pool of free hormone found in serum. This increases the amount of free T4 and has been demonstrated in animal models following administration of a xenobiotic competitive ligand.

Kohrle et al (1989) administered 2 umol of EMD 21388 per 100g BW in a single ip injection to euthyroid adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rat serum was analyzed for T3 and T4 content via species-adapted RIA and percent free TH was determined via equilibrium dialysis. Serum T4 decreased significantly following 1 hr or administration and remained low for several hours, while&nbsp;% free T4 increased significantly at 1 hr and remained elevated. {insert Figure 5} Previously, both in vitro and in vivo electrophoretic data showed complete inhibition of radiolabeled T4 binding to TTR. Administration of EMD 21388 to rats did not impact T3 concentrations or deiodinase activity.

Lueprasitsakul et al (1990) also administered EMD 21388 to euthyroid adult male Sprague-Dawley rats as a single 2 umol ip injection with additional time points as well as a single injection of 0.3 umol. In addition, one treatment group were exposed to varying doses from 0.2 to 2 umol EDM21388 per 100 g BW. Significant decreases in radiolabeled T4 bound to TTR were found within 3 minutes, reaching a maximum at 10 minutes. A simultaneous increase in&nbsp;% free T4 was noted at 3 minutes and reached a maximum at 10 minutes. {insert Figure 3} These effects were observed for both the high dose of 2 umol and the low dose of 0.3 umol; however, it was noted that&nbsp;% T4 bound to TTR recovered to almost control levels after 3 hours at the low dose. The authors concluded that EMD 21388 administration increased both the free T4 concentration as well as the albumin-bound T4 (which is available in serum and can play a greater role in transport when needed).

Mendel et al (1992) performed additional kinetic studies with radiolabeled T4 and albumin using Sprague-Dawley rats receiving a single ip injection of 2 umol EMD 21388. To overcome the dilution effect found with equilibrium dialysis, ultrafiltration of undiluted serum was employed to measure the&nbsp;% free T4. The&nbsp;% free T4 increased significantly at 20 minutes and the compensatory response of albumin appears to have been saturated after 20 minutes, as shown by the plasma disappearance curve for radiolabeled albumin. {insert Figures 2 and 3} The authors concluded that these data did not confirm TTR is a major carrier of T4 from plasma to liver and other tissues; however, these data also did not distinguish between whether transfer in vivo could be via albumin or from the free pool of T4 in serum.

Chanoine et al (1992) administered low (0.3 umol) and high dose (2 umol) EMD 21388 to Sprague-Dawley rats via single ip injection and a second treatment group had radiolabeled T4 injected 15 minutes following the EMD 21388 adminisatration. Both doses produced a similar significant increase to free T4 in serum within 15 minuteas of administration. {insert Figure 1} Binding of T4 to albumin in serum increased an order of magnitude in both high and low dose treatments. The low dose had no effect on the&nbsp;%T4 bound to TTR in the choroid plexus or the cerebrospinal fluid; however, the high dose did significantly decrease this. {insert Figure 2}

Total T4 is most often measured using a serum-based diagnostic kit; however, free T4 is considered a more reliable measure of thyroid dysfunction and the only direct measurements for unbound thyroid hormone are equilibrium dialysis and ultrafiltration (Zoeller et al 2007). Large volumes of serum must be used to capture the very low concentrations of free THs and this requires pooling in non-adult animals.

&nbsp;

Total T4 is most often measured using human serum based diagnostic kits, but free T4 (and T3) is only directly measured through equilibrium dialysis and ultrafiltration (Midgley 2001). Large volumes of serum must be used due to the very low concentrations of free T4 normally found (0.1% of total T4), which requires pooling of samples taken from fetus or pup. Some researchers have tried to &ldquo;micronize&rdquo; this process through combining RIA to measure total TH and dialysis to estimate the free fraction (Zoeller et al 2007).&nbsp; Extracted materials can also be quantified by HPLC. The reference range for free T4 is 9.8 to 18.8 pM/L (Dirinck et al 2016).

T3 is found in similar plasma concentrations to T4 (i.e. 5-10 pM) with &lt; 0.4% being in the unbound state. Measuring free serum T3 is labor intensive and requires equipment not available in many clinical reference laboratories and thus ultrafiltration is often used (Abdalla and Bianco 2014). Immunoassays and MS/MS are also used.

Measuring displacement of T4 from serum transport proteins is done mainly via one of three in vitro methods: radioligand binding assay, plasmon resonance-based biosensor, or fluorescence displacement.

	dcterms:description	"""T4 (and T3) is actively transported across the cell membrane into target tissues through the action of specific carrier-mediated uptake (simple diffusion probably plays a minor role), where it is T3 that binds to and triggers the nuclear receptors in the target cells (Yen 2001, Zoeller et al 2007). The T3 supply is met via secretion from the thyroid (20%) and through conversion of T4 into T3 (80%) through the action of outer-ring deiodinase enzymes D1 and D3 (Chopra 1996 from Zoeller et al 2007). THs are cleared from serum by the liver following sulfation (via sulfotransferase enzymes) or glucuronidation (via UDP-glucuronosyl transferase enzymes) and ultimately, eliminated in the bile (Hood and Klaasen 2000).

Two major groups of transporters have been identified: organic anionic transport proteins (OATPs) and amino acid transporters (L- and T-type). Several of these transporters have displayed greater affinity and selectivity for T4 and T3 and specific compounds (such as polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diethyl ethers) have been found to bind to the transport proteins either in serum or in various cellular compartments (Zoeller et al 2007)

OATPs transport both iodothyronines as well as sulfated conjugates and the gene family (SLCO) coding for this family of homologous proteins is clustered on human 12p12 (Hagenbuch and Meier 2004). OATP1A2 is expressed in brain, liver and kidney while OATP1B1, -1B2, and -1B3 are expressed in the liver and display high affinity for both T4 and T3 (Friesma et al 2005). OATP1C1 shows binding preference for T4 over T3 and is almost exclusively expressed in brain capillaries, where it is thought to play a role for transport of T4 across the blood brain barrier (Tohyama et al 2004).

There is also evidence that L-type or T-type amino acid transport proteins also play a role in cellular uptake of thyroid hormones. The former transport large neutral branched-chain and aromatic amino acids while the latter are specific to the aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr and Trp (Visser 2010). The T-type amino acid transport protein TAT1 has been cloned from both rats and humans, is encoded by SLC16A10, and is a member of the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family (MCT10)(Kim et al 2002). Both MCT and MCT8 share a high degree of homology and are both highly effective iodothyronine transporters. MCT8 is highly selective for T4 and T, responsible for transporting T3 into neuronal cells and interferes with brain development if absent (Friesma et al 2003, 2006 and 2008). MCT8 is expressed in multiple tissues, including liver, kidney, heart, brain, placenta, thyroid, skeletal muscle and adrenal gland, while MCT10 is also expressed in various tissues, with high expression in muscle, intestine, kidney and pancreas and the former is known to only transport iodothyronine molecules while the latter can also carry aromatic amino acids (Nishimura et al 2008). In terms of transport efficacy, MCT10 appears to be superior to MCT8 for moving T3; however, the reverse is true for T4.

Uptake into hepatocytes is probably mediated through multiple low-affinity/high-capacity and high-affinity/low-capacity processes that can be inhibited by certain molecules, such as fatty acids, bilirubin and indoxyl sulfate (Henneman et al 2001). Km values for these processes are in the micro- to nanomolar range, while the serum concentrations of free T4 and T3 are in the picomolar range.

&nbsp;

Accumulation in tissue as well as transport across the placental and blood-brain barrier is dependent on expression level of the various TH membrane transporters, such as those in the MCT and OATP families. MCT8, MCT10, L-type amino acid transporters LAT1 and LAT2, OATP1A2 and OATP4A1 are responsible for transplacental transfer of TH (Loubiere et al 2010), while MCT8 and OATP1C1 are important to transfer across the blood-brain barrier (Roberts et al 2008).

OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 show preference for sulfated THs and are expressed only in the liver

OATP1C1 shows high preference for T4 and almost exclusively expressed in brain capillaries and choroid plexus (Hagenbuch 2007)

LAT1 and LAT2 facilitate bidirectional transport of both T4 and T3 (and aliphatic and aromatic amino acids) across the plasma membrane

MCT8 only transports THs and expressed in choroid plexus, MCT10 also transports aromatic amino acids

Schroder van der Elst et al 1997 injected female rats with synthetic flavonoid [125I]-EMD 49209 and [131I]-T4 (or rats pretreated with EMD 21388), noting rapid clearance of [125I] from serum and rapid uptake of [131I] into tissues. These results show that the flavonoid itself does not cross the blood-brain barrier, despite the fact that they demonstrate displacement of T4 from TTR and temporarily increase the pool of available free T4.&nbsp;

Schroder van der Elst et al 1998 injected pregnant rats at GD 20 with [125I]-EMD 49209 and observed distribution in maternal tissues, intestinal contents and fetal tissues. No flavonoid was detected in the brain but it was found in all fetal tissues examined, including brain.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

TRANSPORT ACROSS THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER

Active transport is required for uptake of T3 and T4 across cell membranes (Heuer 2007). Accumulation in tissue as well as transport across the placental and blood-brain barrier (BBB) is dependent on expression level of the various TH membrane transporters, such as those in the MCT and OATP families. MCT8, MCT10, L-type amino acid transporters LAT1 and LAT2, OATP1A2 and OATP4A1 are responsible for transplacental transfer of TH (Loubiere et al 2010), while MCT8 and OATP1C1 are important to transfer across the blood-brain barrier (Roberts et al 2008).&nbsp; Visser et al 2008 proposed that OATP14 is mainly responsible for moving T4 into the brain/CSF, where it is converted into T3 locally and transported into neurons via MCT8.

Schreiber et al 1995; Schreiber 2002

Roberts et al 2008 examined the expression of MCT8 and OATP14 in male Sprague Dawley rats, male CD-1 mice and human brain tissue via qPCR and immunofluorescent staining as well staining and confocal microscopy in isolated cerebral microvessels and choroid plexus (CP) epithelium.&nbsp; They observed that the main transporter at the BBB is OATP14 whereas MCT8 mediates TH uptake into neuronal cells.&nbsp; MCT8 mRNA and proteins were expressed in cerebral microvessels in all species; however, OATP14 mRNA and protein was only enriched in mouse and rat microvessels.&nbsp; In all species, MCT8 is concentrated on the epithelial cell apical surface and OATP14 primarily on the basal-lateral surface of the CP epithelial cells.&nbsp; These data suggested MCT8 plays a role in TH transport across the BBB and this is supported by the pattern of localization of the two transporters.

&nbsp;

Kim et al 2015 screened protein transporters in rat serum for the potential to guide nanoparticles across the BBB (via receptor-mediated transcytosis, or RMT) using an in vitro transcytosis assay using rat and human brain microvascular endothelial cells.&nbsp; Eleven (11) proteins were identified as showing potential to penetrate the endothelial cell layer via RMT, including Ttr.&nbsp; Ttr was then incorporated into a quantum dot nanoparticle, administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats via IV and found to cross the BBB in rats via transcytosis, confirmed by in vivo imaging, TEM, ICP-MS and confocal microscopy.

&nbsp;

TRANSPORT ACROSS PLACENTA

There is a direct role for maternal TH in the development of the fetal CNS starting with the 1st trimester and this maternal TH must be provided to the fetus via transplacental delivery (Chan et al 2002; de Escobar et al 2004).&nbsp; The placenta responds to TH with both the villous and extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) expressing specific nuclear receptor isoforms for T3.&nbsp; The primary barrier of cells for maternal-fetal exchange are the syncytiotrophoblasts of placental villi, which are in direct contact with maternal blood, and the cytotrophoblasts, which form an additional inner layer of cells (Benirschke et al 2000).&nbsp; Free T4 is the believed to be the primary TH transported across the placenta and fetal free T4 levels reach ~ 40-50% of maternal concentrations by the early 2nd trimester and peak in the early 3rd trimester, where they remain at levels higher than the corresponding maternal concentration (Calvo et al 2002; Hume et al 2004).

Accumulation in tissue as well as transport across the placental and blood-brain barrier is dependent on expression level of the various TH membrane transporters, such as those in the MCT and OATP families. MCT8, MCT10, L-type amino acid transporters LAT1 and LAT2, OATP1A2 and OATP4A1 are responsible for transplacental transfer of TH (Loubiere et al 2010), while MCT8 and OATP1C1 are important to transfer across the blood-brain barrier (Roberts et al 2008).&nbsp; The MCT8, OATP4A1 and LAT1 are localized at the apical membrane of the syncytiotrophoblasts while MCT10 is localized in the cytotrophoblasts during the 1st trimester (Ritchie and Taylor 2001; Sato et al 2003; Chan et al 2006; Loubiere et al 2010)

Displacement of T4 from transport proteins during the developmental stage could have consequences for both fetal development and later in adulthood (Morse et al 1996). &nbsp;Transfer of maternal TH across the placenta is essential to neurodevelopment and even temporary disruption during the perinatal period can have long-term adverse health effects (Zoeller and Rovet 2004). Animal studies have confirmed that perinatal exposure to PBDEs can adversely affect neurodevelopment of CNS; however, the mechanisms remain elusive and the evidence in humans that hydroxylated metabolites of PBDEs is equivocal (Costa et al 2014).

TTR mediates transport through the placenta and the hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs and PBDEs have been found to more potent than the natural ligand T4 and thus, competitive binders. The presence of these compounds in maternal and infant blood have been associated with changes in TH, developmental endpoints and fertility in humans (Chevrier et al 2010, Harley et al 2010, Koopman-Esseboom et al 1994).&nbsp; Several studies have demonstrated links between decreased T4 levels and neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral adverse outcomes in mice exposed specifically to BDE-99 (Branchi et al 2002; Viberg et al 2002).

Darnerud et al 1996 treated pregnant C57BL and NMRI mice on GD 13 with a single gavage at two doses of [14C]-labelled 3,3&rsquo;,4,4&rsquo;-tetraCB (PCB 77) and experiment was terminated after 4 days, measuring radioactivity and TH in maternal and fetal liver and plasma. Competitive binding assay was also done with [125I]-T4 complex from samples of fetal and maternal plasma. Dose-dependent uptake of [14C] were noted in both maternal and fetal plasma and liver, with fetal plasma radioactivity levels being 4- to 9-fold higher than maternal levels and corresponded to a single metabolite (4-OH-tetraCB).&nbsp; Gel electrophoresis confirmed the [14C] was bound to fetal serum TTR and the fetal sera samples at the top dose (10 mg/kg) showed 50% TTR binding relative to controls, along with significant decrease in free and total serum T4.

Morse et al 1996 (also see Morse et al 1993) treated Wistar rats with Aroclor 1254 at 2 doses via daily oral exposure from GD 10 to 16, with blood and tissue (brain, liver) collected from dams and fetuses on GD 20 with pups reared until PND Day 21 (with blood and tissue collected at PND 4 and 21).&nbsp; The biological samples were analyzed for TH, type II deiodinase activity and levels of PCBs and metabolites.&nbsp; Maternal exposure to Aroclor 1254 significantly reduced both free and total T4 in the serum of fetus and neonate (Day 4) in a dose-dependent manner (but less pronounced at PND 21 and absent at Day 90). At GD 20, levels of T4 in fetal forebrain and cerebellum, and at PND 21 female weanlings at the high dose (25 mg/kg) still had significantly decreased forebrain T4.&nbsp; In the fetus, deiodination (T4 to T3) was significantly increased in forebrain and in the female weanling, only at the low dose was deiodination significantly decreased. Similarly, glucuronidation was significantly decreased in the fetus and significantly increased in the female weanling. Accumulation of mainly one metabolite (2,3,3&rsquo;,4&rsquo;,5-pentachloro-4-biphenylol, or 4-OH-pentaCB; possibly from PCB 118 or PCB 126) was noted in fetal serum and forebrain as well as neonatal and weanling plasma and the concentrations of the metabolite in plasma relative to the more persistent parent congeners (PCB 153) were increased all the way to 90 days (and the plasma levels of the offspring exceeded that of dam all the way to 90 days).&nbsp; These data show that maternal exposure to PCBs can result in accumulation of hydroxylated metabolites in fetal plasma that reduces T4 and, as a result, reduces brain levels of T4 with a compensatory increase in brain deiodination to maintain brain T3 concentration.

Pedraza et al 1996 treated pregnant Wistar rats first with methimazole (to block hormone synthesis) and then continuous infusion of EMD 21388 and T4 from GD 11 to 21, noting decreased total T4, increased free T4 and decreased T3 in maternal serum, increase of T3 in placenta and led to measurable amounts of parent compound in fetal serum along with decreased total T4 and increased T3.

Schroder van der Elst et al 1998 injected pregnant rats at GD 20 with [125I]-EMD 49209 and observed distribution in maternal tissues, intestinal contents and fetal tissues. No flavonoid was detected in the maternal brain but it was found in all fetal tissues examined, including brain.&nbsp; It should be noted though that TTR is the principal carrier in the fetal rat and the EMD flavonoids were designed as T4 analogs and only bind to TTR (and not to albumin or TBG).&nbsp; Shortly after birth, TTR production decreases to nearly zero and thus, interference with TTR-T4 during certain developmental windows might impact availability of thyroid hormone in certain tissues at critical time periods.

Sinjari and Darnerud (1998) injected C57BL mice on GD 16 with 5 doses of [14C]-labelled metabolites of PCB 77 (4-OH-tetraCB, two different 4-OH-pentaCB metabolites of PCB105), sacrificed 24 hours later, plasma and tissues collected from dam and fetus and analyzed for [14C], total T4 and liver microsomes.&nbsp; Partial dose dependency was found for both maternal and fetal decreased total T4 for 4-OH-tetraCB and one of the pentaCBs.&nbsp; Also, placental transfer to fetal plasma was dose dependent and, at lower doses (less than 5 mg/kg), fetal serum levels of 4-OH-tetraCB were 2-fold higher than maternal serum levels.&nbsp; The authors conclude that doses in excess of 5 mg/kg saturate ligand binding, as effects measured at concentrations higher than this are not dose-related (however, there was extensive biliary excretion of 4-OH-tetraCB at the highest doses (20 and 50 &micro;mol/kg).&nbsp; These results suggest that hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs are transferred to fetus upon maternal exposure, but did not induce a CYP1A1 or CYP1A2 response in the dam and competitive binding with T4 may not be the only mechanism behind noted adverse fetal effects from T4 modulation.

Meerts et al 2002 treated pregnant rats with 5 mg/kg of 4-OH-CB107 (radiolabeled and non-labelled) on GD 10 to 16, noting accumulation in the fetal compartment. The complex between TTR and [14C]-4-OH-CB107 was detected in serum in both dam and fetus. &nbsp;Total and free serum T4 were reduced in fetus at GD 17 and 20. T4 concentration in fetal forebrain homogenate was reduced at GD20 and deiodination of T4 to T3 was increased at GD 17.&nbsp; No changes were noted in maternal or fetal hepatic UDP-UGT activity, type 1 deiodination, or EROD activity.&nbsp; These data show that TTR-mediated transport of xenobiotics, like the metabolites of PCB 107, can result in transfer from mother to fetus and can result in reduced fetal T4 (although it should be noted that fetal T3 remained unaffected). Furthermore, there was significant increase of fetal TSH at GD20, indicating stimulation of the HPT axis.

Inoue et al 2004 reported that PFOS can cross the placental barrier in humans

McKinnon et al 2005

Morse et al 2005 injected pregnant Wistar rats on GD 13 with single dose of [14C]-labelled 3,3&rsquo;,4,4&rsquo;-tetraCB (PCB 77) and tracked metabolism for 7 days.&nbsp; The main metabolite was 4-OH-CB77 was found in maternal liver and plasma, placental tissue and fetal plasma, with 4-OH-CB77 accumulating 100-fold in fetus over the observation period with levels in fetal plasma being 14-fold higher than maternal plasma on GD 20. Similarly, while maternal serum T4 was initially significantly reduced and recovered by GD 20, the fetal plasma T4 was found to be significantly reduced relative to maternal T4 on GD 20. These data show that exposure to PCBs during pregnancy can result on transfer of metabolites to fetus (and these are competitive with T4 at the TTR binding site).

Riu et al 2008 fed pregnant Wistar rats with [14C]-decabromodiphenyl ether (DBDE) over 96 hr of late gestation (GD 16 to 19) and tissues analyzed via HPLC.&nbsp; More than 19% of the administered dose was recovered, with 2/3 of this eliminated via feces, and results in accordance with past findings in Fisher and Sprague Dawley rats.&nbsp; Small amounts were found to cross both the blood-brain and placental barriers and hydroxylated octaBDE was found in all tissues and fetus.

Dalliare et al 2009a looked at the relationship between TH status TBG and exposure to PCB-153, pentachlorophenol, hexachlorobenzene and hydroxylated PCBs in pregnant Inuit women and their infants. PCB-153 was the most predominant congener found to be elevated most in pregnant women, followed by infant and cord plasma levels.&nbsp; OH-PCB results were a sum of 11 major congeners and found to be higher in pregnant women than cord blood, but highly intercorrelated.&nbsp; Overall, the results suggest that the compounds measured in serum were not significant predictors of TH or TSH concentrations in this population.&nbsp; The strongest results were found for PCP, which was negatively associated with free T4 in neonate cord blood, suggesting PCP reduces the transfer of T4 across the placenta. This confirmed previous findings of Sandau et al 2002, but has conflicted with other study populations and published reports; however, has biological plausibility as PCP has been reported to have a binding affinity twice that of the natural ligand for TTR (van den Berg 1990).

Loubiere et al 2010 described the ontogeny of TH transporters MCT8, MCT10, LAT1, LAT2, OATP1A2 and OATP4A1 in over 100 placenta samples collected across gestation via RNA extraction and qRT-PCR.&nbsp; These mRNA data showed increasing expression of MCT8, MCT10, OATP1A2 and LAT1 throughout gestation, while OATP4A1 and CD98 (associated with LAT activity) mRNA fell to a nadir in the late 1st and early 2nd trimester. Immunohistochemistry data localized MCT10 and OATP1A2 for the first time to EVTs as well as syncytiotrophoblasts.

	mmo:0000000	"""Total T4 is most often measured using human serum based diagnostic kits, but free T4 (and T3) is only directly measured through equilibrium dialysis and ultrafiltration (Midgley 2001). Large volumes of serum must be used due to the very low concentrations of free T4 normally found (0.1% of total T4), which requires pooling of samples taken from fetus or pup. Some researchers have tried to &ldquo;micronize&rdquo; this process through combining RIA to measure total TH and dialysis to estimate the free fraction (Zoeller et al 2007).&nbsp; Extracted materials can also be quantified by HPLC. The reference range for free T4 is 9.8 to 18.8 pM/L (Dirinck et al 2016).

T3 is found in similar plasma concentrations to T4 (i.e. 5-10 pM) with &lt; 0.4% being in the unbound state. Measuring free serum T3 is labor intensive and requires equipment not available in many clinical reference laboratories and thus ultrafiltration is often used (Abdalla and Bianco 2014). Immunoassays and MS/MS are also used.

Measuring displacement of T4 from serum transport proteins is done mainly via one of three in vitro methods: radioligand binding assay, plasmon resonance-based biosensor, or fluorescence displacement.

Radioligand binding assays, using [125I]-T4 as a label, were developed to demonstrate affinity for xenobiotics to human or rat TTR and TBG (Brouwer and van den Berg 1986, Lans et al 1994). &nbsp;The most commonly used method was first published by Somack et al 1982 and adapted by Hamers et al 2006, Lans et al 1993 and Ucan-Marin et al 2010. Similar assays have been developed using [125I]-T3 as a label for affinity to chicken and bullfrog TTR (Yamauchi et al 2003).&nbsp; Radioligand methods suffer from having to use heavily regulated isotopes and lower throughput to provide free T4 measurements (due to the extra wash/separation procedure needed). The most well-known protocol uses TTR purified from human serum (which may not be as stable as recombinant) and performed in a pure aqueous solution, which may not be as stable for lipophilic compounds (Chauhan et al 2000 is an example using PCBs).

Purkey et al 2001 published a binding assay using polyclonal TTR antibodies covalently bound to sepharose resin which is then mixed with plasma pre-treated with compound of interest, washed and analyzed via HPLC.

Marchesini et al 2006 reported on the development of two surface plasmon resonance(SPR)-based biosensor assays using recombinant TTR and TBG, validated with known thyroid disruptors and structurally related compounds including halogenated phenols, polychlorinated biphenyls, bisphenols and a hydroxylated PCB metabolite (4-OH-CB 14).&nbsp; TH is covalently bound to a gold-layered chip and a mixture of the compound of interest and transport protein are injected in a flow cell passing over the bound TH.&nbsp; The authors found that these biosensor methods were more sensitive (IC50 of 8.6 &plusmn; 0.7 nM for rTTR), easier to perform and more rapid that radioligand binding assays and immunoprecipitation-HPLC.

Marchesini et al 2008 applied their biosensor-based screen to 62 chemicals of public health concern and found that hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs (particularly para-hydroxylated ones) and PBDEs (BDEs 47, 49 and 99) displayed the most potent binding to TBG and TTR, confirming many other previous studies.&nbsp; The authors conclude their optimized assays are suitable for high-throughput screening for potential thyroid disruption.

Cao et al 2010, Cao et al 2011 and Ren and Guo 2012 developed the FLU-TTR, based on a protein-binding fluorescent probe (ANSA, or 8-anilo-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid ammonium salt) that becomes highly fluorescent after binding to T4. When the compound of interest is introduced and displaces the ANSA-thyroxine probe, this fluorescence is reduced.&nbsp; This allows generation of binding constant (K) data as opposed to past efforts that generated IC50 values.&nbsp; Cao et al 2011 developed a fluorescent microtiter method for pTTR and TBG tested with bisphenol A.

Montano et al 2012 developed a competitive T4-TTR fluorescence displacement assay in a 96-well format, modified from the original method (Nilsson and Petersen 1975) and using a new selective method to extract hydroxylated metabolites while reducing fatty acid interference (modified from Hovander et al 2000).

Aqai et al 2012 described a rapid and isotope-free (13C6-T4) screening of thyroid transport protein ligands, using a competitive binding assay for rTTR using fast ultrahigh performance LC-electrospray ionization triple-quadrupole MS. The method involves the use of immunomagnetic beads followed by screening with flow cytometry and UPLC-MS. The high-throughput screening mode is capable of detecting T4 in water at the part-per-trillion level and in the part-per-billion level in urine.

Relevant Phase II enzymes that are responsible for TH metabolism include UGT1A1, UGT1A6 and SULT2A1 while relevant cellular import/export transport proteins include MCT8, OATP1A4 and MRP2. All contribute towards systemic clearance of TH and conjugates from serum whether increasing biliary excretion or moving TH into tissues and across the placenta and BBB.&nbsp; Enzyme induction can only be measured via in vitro cell-based assays and since these enzymes are all controlled by specific nuclear receptors, assays targeting these receptors might act as surrogate measurement (Murk et al 2013). Several methods measuring expression of UGT or SULT mRNA have been published; however, there have been limited efforts to develop higher-throughput methods.&nbsp; The EPA ToxCast Phase I efforts used quantitative nuclease protection assays (qNPA) to screen several hundred chemicals for UGT1A1 and SULT2A1 (Rotroff et al 2010, Sinz et al 2006).

	dcterms:description	"""Thyroxin (T4) and T3 are metabolized and cleared from tissues in a number of ways: inner ring or outer ring deiodination via specific enzymes, conjugation (glucuronidation or sulfation), oxidative deamination and ether-linked cleavage (Zoeller et al 2007).

Deiodination:

There are three types of deiodinase enzymes. D1 and D2 convert T4 to T3 by removing an iodine atom from the outer ring while D3 removes an iodine atom from the inner ring, converting T4 to reverse T3. Differential expression of these enzymes during brain development are critical to the functionality of thyroid hormone in different areas of the fetal brain.

Much of the T4 is carried to the liver, where it is transported across the cellular membrane, converted into T3 via deiodination as mediated by deiodinase enzymes, and it is this T3 that triggers the TH receptors found in the nucleus. Roughly 80% of the T3 needed is produced via outer-ring deiodination of T4, which &quot;activates&quot; T4 to T3 (as opposed to inner-ring deiodination, which &quot;degrades&quot; T4 to reverse T3 which is eliminated). About 30% of the T4 produced daily (~ 130 nmol) is converted to roughly 40 nmol of T3 (Visser 2012) via enzyme D1 (liver, kidney) while conversion to rT3 accounts for roughly 40% of T4 turnover and is mediated via enzyme D3 (brain, placenta, fetus).

Conjugation:

Glucuronidation and sulfation of T4 accounts for the rest of the metabolized T4 and leads to rapid elimination through bile. It is thought that 20% of daily T4 production is eliminated through biliary excretion of glucuronide conjugates. Glucuronidation is carried out by UDP-glucuronoyltransferase (UGT) enzymes (Hood and Klaassen 2000a, 2000b) and appears to be more important in murine species than in man (Henneman and Visser 1997) and sulfation of T4 is done largely through an initial inner ring deiodination step (via D3). Circulating levels of THs in serum can be affected by compounds that induce the activity of UDP-UGT enzymes.

Uptake into the liver involves &quot;high affinity, low capacity&quot; and &quot;low affinity, high capacity&quot; processes with Km values in the nano- to micro-molar range (as opposed to the free T3 and T4 concentrations, which are in the picomolar range) (Henneman et al 2001 from Visser 2010). Both MCT8 and MCT 10 can transport THs; however, MCT8 is expressed in human liver where MCT10 is not and MCT8 display higher efficacy of cellular uptake and efflux relative to T3 (Ref 12 in Visser 2010).

Data in animals for PCBs

Previous reports have been made showing serum TH decreases in rats and mice in response to PCBs, PCB congeners and TCDD and these decreases have been thought to be driven by UDP-UGT (particularly 1A1 and 1A6)(Barter and Klaassen 1994, Schuur et al 1997, Van Birgelen et al 1995, Visser 1996)

Hallgren et al 2001, Hallgren and Darnerud 2002 showed that both T4 and T3 are significantly decreased following exposure to PCB mixtures or individual congeners.

Kato et al 2003 (and Kato et al 2002) showed for the first time that a commercial PCB mixture (Kanechlor-500, KC500) decreased serum TH without an increase in glucuronidation of T4. Male Wistar rats and ddy mice were given a single ip injection of 100 mg/kg and 4 days later, organ weights were measured and microsomal enzymes measured.&nbsp; Significant increases were noted for both endpoints in both species; however, treatment with PCBs led to significant increases in UDP-UGT activity in rats but not mice. Gene expression of UDP-UGTs was also examined and, again, rats (but not mice) displayed time-dependent increases in levels of UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 following treatment with PCBs.&nbsp; This agrees with past reports showing that clofibrate, phenobarbital, pregnenolone-16-alpha-carbonitrile and beta-naphthoflavone decrease serum TH and increase hepatic UDP-UGT activity in rats but not mice (Viollon-Abadie et al 1999).&nbsp;&nbsp;

This implies that mice may reduce serum TH through a mechanism that does not involve increased glucuronidation, but may involve a TTR-associated pathway (as hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs have been displayed high affinity for TTR in in vitro studies).&nbsp; Kanechlor-500 does not display any appreciable amount of outer ring deiodination activity (which would convert serum T4 to T3) and treatment with the mixture did not significantly change TSH levels (indicating there is no induction of the thyroid feedback loop from the measured decreases in serum TH).&nbsp;

Kato et al 2004 performed the same experiment next with Wistar and Gunn rats, the latter species being a Wistar mutant strain that lacks UGT1A isoforms.&nbsp; Both species showed serum T4 (free and total) decrease after single injection of either KC500 or pentaCB and only Wistar rats showed an associated increase in UDP-UGT activity. Significant decrease in type I deiodinase was observed in both rats in addition to detection of hydroxylated PCB metabolites bound to TTR.&nbsp; Gunn rats treated with clofibrate also showed decreased serum T4 without an increase in UDP-UGT activity (Visser et al 1993).&nbsp; These results imply that decreases of serum TH by PCB or pentaCB were managed by formation of OH-PCB metabolites that were then transported by TTR.&nbsp; This is supported by the fact that the main metabolite found in KC500-treated rats was 4-OH-2,3,3&rsquo;,4&rsquo;,5-pentachlorobiphenyl, which displays a binding affinity towards TTR that exceeds that of T4 by more than 3-fold (Meerts et al 2002).&nbsp; In fact, the dihydrohxylated PCBs show several fold higher affinity than the monohydroxylated PCBs (Lans et al 1993).&nbsp; It should be noted that an increase in sulfation via SULT enzymes may also offer an esxplanation for the observed results.

Kato et al 2007 treated Wistar and Gunn rats with KC500 at a lower dose (10 mg/kg) once daily for 10 days, noting decrease in total and free serum T4 as well as the differential UDP-UGT response across the different strains.&nbsp; Clearance of [125I]T4 from serum was higher in both species treated with KC500 and accumulation in several tissues, particularly the liver, was observed.&nbsp; These data imply that reduction of serum TH from exposure to KC500 would be mediated through accumulation in the tissues and not through an increase in glucuronidation.&nbsp; In addition, competitive inhibition by PCB or its metabolites with serum transport proteins (like TTR) could also decrease serum T4 by inducing a change in tissue distribution, especially the liver where more than 40% of[125I]T4 accumulated following treatment.

Kato et al 2009 treated C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice with the heptaCB metabolite 4-OH-CB187, decreasing free and total serum T4 with no observed UDP-UGT activity or effect on TSH.&nbsp; A number of OH-PCBs have been identified in human serum, including 4-OH-CB107, 3-OH-CB153, 4-OH-CB146, 3&rsquo;-OH-CB138 and 4-OH-CB187 (which specifically has a 5-fold higher affinity for TTR relative to T4)(Hovander et al 2002).&nbsp; Levels of [125I]T4-TTR were decreased with accompanying increases in binding to TBG and albumin in both strains of mice. Finally, T4 levels increased in tissues, particularly the liver and kidney.&nbsp; Decreases in total and free serum T4 mediated by 4-OH-CB187 were observed in wild-type and TTR-heterozygous mice but not in TTR-deficient mice, with heterozygous mice displaying a smaller decrease in T4 relative to TTR-deficient mice.&nbsp; In both strains of mice, treatment with 4-OH-CB187 promoted clearance of [125I]T4 from serum relative to controls and serum pharmacokinetic data were estimated, along with tissue-to-serum (Kp value) concentration ratios and [125I]T4 tissue distribution levels. These data imply that 4-OH-CB187 inhibits formation of the [125I]T4-TTR complex, which may lead to a change in tissue distribution, with accumulation in the liver and kidney mainly.

Kato et al 2012 treated C57BL/6 (wild type) and TTR-null mice with single ip injections of pentaCB at 112 mg/kg, noting significant decreases in total serum T4 and T4-TTR complex and measuring [125I]T4 clearance from serum and accumulation in tissues.&nbsp; Treatment with pentaCB resulted in decrease of [125I]T4-TTR and increase in [125I]T4-albumin and [125I]T4-TBG complexes in wild type mice, but not in TTR-deficient mice, although liver accumulation was noted in both strains independent of UDP-UGT activity.&nbsp; These data imply that penta-CB mediated increases in T4 liver concentration occurs mainly through inhibition of efflux of T4 and/or promotion on influx of T4 into hepatic cells (which is a receptor mediated process independent of TTR transport at the liver).

Kato et al 2013 treated C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice with 50 mg/kg CB118 (pentaCB) in a single ip injection for 5 days, noting decreased serum T4 in both strains and decrease in TSH for the DBA/2 mice but not C57BL/6.&nbsp; &nbsp;CB118-mediated changes in [125I]T4 complexes with TBG, albumin and TTR were only observed in C57BL/6 mice (and not DBA/2), despite [125I]T4 accumulation in the liver of both strains. It is thought that the strain differences are dependent on differences in induction of CYP1A enzymes responsible for the hydroxylation of PCBs (creating metabolites that display far greater affinity for TTR than the natural T4 ligand).

Martin and Klaassen 2010 treated male Sprague Dawley rats with Aroclors 1242 and 1254; PCBs 95, 99, 118, 126 or TCDD at 4 doses via gavage daily for 7 days, then measured serum TH via radioimmunoassay and induction of hepatic Cyp1a and Cyp2b.&nbsp; This study was the first to examine all three classes of PCB congeners: TCDD-type (no chlorine substitutions in ortho position, high affinity for arylhydrocarbon receptor, induce Cyp1a, PCBs 77 and 126), PB-type (at least 2 ortho substitutions, low affinity for AhR, induce Cyp2b, PCBs 28, 95, 99, 101 and 153) or mixed type (1 ortho substitution, low affinity for AhR, induce both Cyp1a and Cyp2b, Aroclors and PCB 118).&nbsp; This study showed that PB-type and mixed type PCB congeners are more effective than TCDD type in reducing serum T4, with Aroclor 1254 (mixed) and PCBs 99 (PB) and 118 (mixed) producing the greatest reduction in serum T4 (as well as T3).&nbsp; Serum TSH was not affected by any compound.&nbsp; Total and free serum T4 was decreased by all treatments in a dose-dependent manner; however marked reduction were noted following treatment with Aroclor 1254, PCB 99 and PCB 118. PCB 118 and 126 caused significant increase in Cyp1a activity while Aroclor 1254 and PCBs 99 and 118 significantly induced Cyp2b.&nbsp; Thus, it appears TCDD type congeners induce CYP1A2 (EROD) activity and UGT-UDP activity in the liver (associated wth binding at AhR) while PB type congeners induce CYP1B2 (PROD) activity and do not induce UGT-UDPs in the liver (associated with increased tissue uptake).

The PB type congeners may induce Oatp1a4 activity to increase clearance from plasma and enhance tissue uptake. Guo et al 2002 reported increase of Oatp1a4 following treatment with PCB 99 (and a decrease following treatment with PCB 126, a TCDD type congener). There are also reports of PB type congeners that accumulate in the liver with little to no increase in glucuronidation or biliary excretion and no changes in serum binding proteins, such as PCB 153, which implies a possible induction of OATP hepatic cellular transport proteins (Kato et al 2011).

Martin et al 2012 treated male Wistar rats with Aroclors 1242 and 1254, PCBs 95, 99, 118 and 126 and TCDD via gavage one per day for 7 days, followed 24 hours later with injection of [125I]T4 and collection of urine, blood, bile and urine. No treatments increased urinary excretion of [125I]T4, but serum T4 was reduced in all treatments and biliary excretion increased following treatment of Aroclor 1254, PCBs 118 and 126, and TCDD as measured by induction of UDP-UGT activity in the liver. PCBs 95 and 99 (PB type congeners) did not induce UGT-UDP activity despite very large and rapid decrease of serum [125I]T4 by PCB 99.&nbsp; These data imply that increased tissue uptake (perhaps through increased TH transport across cell membranes) is another mechanism by which serum T4 can be reduced.&nbsp;

Kato et al 2013 showed that PCB 118 (mixed type) mediated changes in tissue distribution and transport proteins in C57BL/6 mice, but not DBA/2 mice.&nbsp; Kato et al 2012 showed the same with synthesized 2,2&rsquo;,4,5,5&rsquo;-pentaCB (PCB 101, PB type). Kato et al 2014 showed that PCB 77 (TCDD type) mediated changes in tissue distribution and transport proteins in DBA/2 mice, but not C57BL/6 mice.

Erratico et al 2012 used pooled and single-donor human liver microsomes, human recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and CYP-specific antibodies to evaluate the oxidative metabolism of BDE-99.&nbsp; Ten (10) hydroxylated metabolites were produced by human microsomes and identified via HPLC-MS/MS and rates of formation were determined, including several that are much more potent than the natural ligand.&nbsp; All ten were found to be catalyzed solely by CYP2B6.&nbsp; Previous studies had also shown formation of hydroxylated metabolites of BDE-99 by human hepatic preparations (Lupton et al 2009, 2010; Stapleton et al 2009); however, fewer OH-PBDEs and additional CYP enzymes were found in similar work done with rat microsomes (Erratico et al 2011).

Feo et al 2013 incubated BDE-47 and recombinant CYPs, measuring the metabolites via GC-MS/MS, as well as specific kinetic studies with BDE-47, CYP2B6 and pooled human liver microsomes.&nbsp; Six (6) OH-PBDEs were found to be catalyzed by CYP2B6 and additional metabolites were identified upon GC-MS/MS (including the novel finding of dihydroxylated metabolites) and these metabolites have been previously found in human serum (Athanasiadou et al 2008; Qui et al 2009).&nbsp; The kinetic studies showed that hydroxylation can occur at low concentrations and that CYPT2B6 has high affinity for BDE-47.&nbsp; CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 were also suggested to play minor roles in the formation of OH-PBDEs.

Thyroid hormone uptake into human tissues has been measured by analyzing the rate of disappearance of radiolabeled TH from plasma into rapidly and slowly equilibrating tissue compartments (Visser 2010).

Measuring the rate of T4 glucuronidation and sulfation as well as biliary excretion informs the mechanism of action of thyroid system modulation. Studies involving knock/out mice and thyroidectomized rats also inform this mechanism.

&nbsp;

Total T4 is most often measured using human serum based diagnostic kits, but free T4 (and T3) is only directly measured through equilibrium dialysis and ultrafiltration (Midgley 2001). Large volumes of serum must be used due to the very low concentrations of free T4 normally found (0.1% of total T4), which requires pooling of samples taken from fetus or pup. Some researchers have tried to &ldquo;micronize&rdquo; this process through combining RIA to measure total TH and dialysis to estimate the free fraction (Zoeller et al 2007).&nbsp; Extracted materials can also be quantified by HPLC. The reference range for free T4 is 9.8 to 18.8 pM/L (Dirinck et al 2016).

T3 is found in similar plasma concentrations to T4 (i.e. 5-10 pM) with &lt; 0.4% being in the unbound state. Measuring free serum T3 is labor intensive and requires equipment not available in many clinical reference laboratories and thus ultrafiltration is often used (Abdalla and Bianco 2014). Immunoassays and MS/MS are also used.

Measuring displacement of T4 from serum transport proteins is done mainly via one of three in vitro methods: radioligand binding assay, plasmon resonance-based biosensor, or fluorescence displacement.

Radioligand binding assays, using [125I]-T4 as a label, were developed to demonstrate affinity for xenobiotics to human or rat TTR and TBG (Brouwer and van den Berg 1986, Lans et al 1994). &nbsp;The most commonly used method was first published by Somack et al 1982 and adapted by Hamers et al 2006, Lans et al 1993 and Ucan-Marin et al 2010. Similar assays have been developed using [125I]-T3 as a label for affinity to chicken and bullfrog TTR (Yamauchi et al 2003).&nbsp; Radioligand methods suffer from having to use heavily regulated isotopes and lower throughput to provide free T4 measurements (due to the extra wash/separation procedure needed). The most well-known protocol uses TTR purified from human serum (which may not be as stable as recombinant) and performed in a pure aqueous solution, which may not be as stable for lipophilic compounds (Chauhan et al 2000 is an example using PCBs).

Purkey et al 2001 published a binding assay using polyclonal TTR antibodies covalently bound to sepharose resin which is then mixed with plasma pre-treated with compound of interest, washed and analyzed via HPLC.

Marchesini et al 2006 reported on the development of two surface plasmon resonance(SPR)-based biosensor assays using recombinant TTR and TBG, validated with known thyroid disruptors and structurally related compounds including halogenated phenols, polychlorinated biphenyls, bisphenols and a hydroxylated PCB metabolite (4-OH-CB 14).&nbsp; TH is covalently bound to a gold-layered chip and a mixture of the compound of interest and transport protein are injected in a flow cell passing over the bound TH.&nbsp; The authors found that these biosensor methods were more sensitive (IC50 of 8.6 &plusmn; 0.7 nM for rTTR), easier to perform and more rapid that radioligand binding assays and immunoprecipitation-HPLC.

Marchesini et al 2008 applied their biosensor-based screen to 62 chemicals of public health concern and found that hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs (particularly para-hydroxylated ones) and PBDEs (BDEs 47, 49 and 99) displayed the most potent binding to TBG and TTR, confirming many other previous studies.&nbsp; The authors conclude their optimized assays are suitable for high-throughput screening for potential thyroid disruption.

Cao et al 2010, Cao et al 2011 and Ren and Guo 2012 developed the FLU-TTR, based on a protein-binding fluorescent probe (ANSA, or 8-anilo-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid ammonium salt) that becomes highly fluorescent after binding to T4. When the compound of interest is introduced and displaces the ANSA-thyroxine probe, this fluorescence is reduced.&nbsp; This allows generation of binding constant (K) data as opposed to past efforts that generated IC50 values.&nbsp; Cao et al 2011 developed a fluorescent microtiter method for pTTR and TBG tested with bisphenol A.

Montano et al 2012 developed a competitive T4-TTR fluorescence displacement assay in a 96-well format, modified from the original method (Nilsson and Petersen 1975) and using a new selective method to extract hydroxylated metabolites while reducing fatty acid interference (modified from Hovander et al 2000).

Aqai et al 2012 described a rapid and isotope-free (13C6-T4) screening of thyroid transport protein ligands, using a competitive binding assay for rTTR using fast ultrahigh performance LC-electrospray ionization triple-quadrupole MS. The method involves the use of immunomagnetic beads followed by screening with flow cytometry and UPLC-MS. The high-throughput screening mode is capable of detecting T4 in water at the part-per-trillion level and in the part-per-billion level in urine.

Relevant Phase II enzymes that are responsible for TH metabolism include UGT1A1, UGT1A6 and SULT2A1 while relevant cellular import/export transport proteins include MCT8, OATP1A4 and MRP2. All contribute towards systemic clearance of TH and conjugates from serum whether increasing biliary excretion or moving TH into tissues and across the placenta and BBB.&nbsp; Enzyme induction can only be measured via in vitro cell-based assays and since these enzymes are all controlled by specific nuclear receptors, assays targeting these receptors might act as surrogate measurement (Murk et al 2013). Several methods measuring expression of UGT or SULT mRNA have been published; however, there have been limited efforts to develop higher-throughput methods.&nbsp; The EPA ToxCast Phase I efforts used quantitative nuclease protection assays (qNPA) to screen several hundred chemicals for UGT1A1 and SULT2A1 (Rotroff et al 2010, Sinz et al 2006).

	dcterms:description	"""The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is a substrate of calcineurin (CN) (Rao et al. 1997). A NFAT has an N-terminal with a plurality of SP motifs rich in serine and proline, which are controlled by means of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. There is a nuclear localization signal (NLS) held between these SP regions as well as a nuclear export signal (NES) in the N-terminal adjacent to the SP motifs (Beals et al. 1997, Zhu and McKeon 1999, Serfling et al. 2000). SP motifs ordinarily are phosphorylated, which covers the NLS and leaves the NES exposed, so that NFAT localizes in cytoplasm. When SP motifs are dephosphorylated by activated CN, the NLS is exposed and the NES is covered, thereby promoting nuclear localization of NFAT (Matsuda and Koyasu 2000, Zhu and McKeon 1999). When T-cell activation takes place, T-cell&ndash;receptor-mediated stimulus increases the intracellular concentration of calcium and activates a regulatory subunit (CnB), which subsequently induces a catalytic subunit (CnA) phosphatase activation, leading to dephosphorylation of NFAT followed by nuclear localization. CN inhibitor -immunophilin complexes inhibit CN phosphatase activation, thereby interfering with NFAT nuclear localization (Bhattacharyya et al.2011).

Thyroid hormones do not only play an important role in the adult individual, but they are also critical during embryonic development. Thyroid hormones (THs) play an important role in a wide range of biological processes in vertebrates including growth, development, reproduction, cardiac function, thermoregulation, response to injury, tissue repair and homeostasis. Numerous chemicals are known to disturb thyroid function, for example by inhibiting thyroperoxidase (TPO) or deiodinase (DIO), upregulating excretion pathways or modifying gene expression. The two major thyroid hormones are triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), both iodinated derivatives of tyrosine. The synthesis of the thyroid hormones is a process that involves several steps. Thyroglobulin, the thyroid hormone precursor, is produced by the thyroid epithelial cells and transported to the lumen via exocytosis. Then thyroperoxidase (TPO) plays an essential role in the production of mainly T4. The prohormone T4 is then released in the circulation under the influence of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), in order to be transported to the various tissues, including the liver, the kidneys and the heart. Most TH actions depend on the binding of T3 to its nuclear receptors. Active and inactive THs are tightly regulated by enzymes called iodothyronine deiodinases (DIO). The activation occurs via outer ring deiodination (ORD), i.e. removing iodine from the phenolic ring of T4 to form T3, while inactivation occurs via inner ring deiodination (IRD), i.e. removing iodine from the inner tyrosol ring of T4 or T3.
Three types of iodothyronine deiodinases (DIO1-3) have been described in vertebrates that activate or inactivate THs and are therefore important mediators of TH action. All deiodinases are integral membrane proteins of the thioredoxin superfamily that contain selenocysteine in their catalytic centre. Type I deiodinase is capable to convert T4 into T3, as well as to convert rT3 to the inactive thyroid hormone 3,3‚Äô T2, through outer ring deiodination. rT3 is the preferred substrate for DIO1 (Hennemann G, Visser TJ 1997). Type II deiodinase (DIO2) is only capable of ORD activity with T4 as a preferred substrate. DIO3 can inner ring deiodinate T4 and T3 to the inactive forms of THs, reverse T3, (rT3) and 3,3‚Äô-T2 respectively.
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""At this time, there are no approved OECD or EPA guideline protocols for measurement of DIO inhibition. Deiodination is the major pathway regulating T3 bioavailability in mammalian tissues. The objective of this in vitro assay is to examine inhibition of deiodinase 2 (DIO2) activity upon exposure to thyroid disrupting compounds, using unexposed pig liver tissue. 
There are three types of deiodinase measurements available. A first in vitro assay measures deiodinase activities by quantifying the radioactive iodine release from iodine-labelled substrates, depending on the preferred substrates of the isoforms of deiodinases. A second assay is a chromatography-based method coupled to mass spectroscopy to measure products of thyroxin by deiodinase type-1 activity (Butt et al., 2010). Finally, a colorimetric method was developed (Renko et al., 2012) that measures the release of iodine from T4. 
Although the radioactive based assays uses radioactivity to measure deiodinase activity, they provide a good balance between specificity and  resources needed. The chromatography-based assay has a high sensitivity and specificity to measure all thyroid hormones metabolites, but a high degree of technical expertise and expensive instrumentation is required. Although the colorimetric method is a promising alternative, the sensitivity of this assay is still limited.
For all the reasons above, we chose to use the radioactive method. Since DIO1 and DIO2 prefer a different substrate to deiodinate, i.e. rT3 and T4 respectively, it is possible to quantify outer-ring deiodination using the specific enzymkinetics of both enzymes. This assay measures the amount of  radioactive iodine that is released from 125I-labelled substrates by conversion of one of the substrates by the DIO enzymes. We used a pig liver homogenate preparation and  reaction buffers containing DTT as co-substrate. Furthermore, a concentration range of potential thyroid-disrupting chemicals can be added to measure the inhibitory potencies of the chemicals the inhibit DIO enzyme activity. Enzym activity is expressed as picomoles or femtomoles of released radioactive iodine per minute per mg protein and if inhibition occurs, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined.

	dcterms:alternative	"Decreased, Triiodothyronine (T3) in serum" ;
	dc:source	"AOPWiki" ;
	dcterms:description	"""There are two biological active thyroid hormones (THs), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), and a few inactive iodothyronines (rT3, 3,5-T2), which are all derived from the modification of tyrosine molecules (Hulbert, 2000). However, the plasma concentrations of the other iodothyronines are significantly lower than those of T3 and T4. The different iodothyronines are formed by the sequential outer or inner ring monodeiodination of T4 by the deiodinating enzymes, Dio1, Dio2, and Dio3 (Gereben et al., 2008). Deiodinase structure is considered to be unique, as THs are the only molecules in the body that incorporate iodide.

The circulatory system serves as the major transport and delivery system for THs from synthesis in the gland to delivery to tissues. The majority of THs in the blood are bound to transport proteins (Bartalena and Robbins, 1993). In humans, the major transport proteins are TBG (thyroxine binding globulin), TTR (transthyretin) and albumin. The percent bound to these proteins in adult humans is about 75, 15 and 10 percent, respectively (Schussler 2000). Unbound (free) hormones are approximately 0.03 and 0.3 percent for T4 and T3, respectively. In serum, it is the free form of the hormone that is active.

There are major species differences in the predominant binding proteins and their affinities for THs (see section below on Taxonomic applicability). However, there is broad agreement that changes in serum concentrations of THs is diagnostic of thyroid disease or chemical-induced disruption of thyroid homeostasis (Zoeller et al., 2007).

It is notable that the changes measured in the TH concentration reflect mainly the changes in the serum transport proteins rather than changes in the thyroid status. These thyroid-binding proteins serve as hormonal store which ensure their even and constant distribution in the different tissues, while they protect the most sensitive ones in the case of severe changes in thyroid availability, like in thyroidectomies (Obregon et al., 1981). Until recently, it was believed that all of the effects of TH were mediated by the binding of T3 to the thyroid nuclear receptors (TRa and TRb), a notion which is now questionable due to the increasing evidence that support the non-genomic action of TH (Davis et al., 2010, Moeller et al., 2006). Many non-nuclear TH binding sites have been identified to date and they usually lead to rapid cellular response in TH-effects (Bassett et al., 2003), but the specific pathways that are activated in this regard need to be elucidated.

The production of THs in the thyroid gland and the circulation levels in the bloodstream are self-controlled by an efficiently regulated feedback mechanism across the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Thyroid (HPT) axis. One of the most unique characteristics of TH is their ability to regulate their own concentration, not only in the plasma level, but also in the individual cell level, to maintain their homeostasis. This is succeed by the efficient regulatory mechanism of the thyroid hormone axis which consists of the following: (1) the hypothalamic secretion of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), (2) the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion from the anterior pituitary, (3) hormonal transport by the plasma binding proteins, (4) cellular uptake mechanisms in the cell level, (5) intracellular control of TH concentration by the deiodinating mechanism (6) transcriptional function of the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor and (7) in the fetus, the transplacental passage of T4 and T3 (Cheng et al., 2010).

In regards to the brain, the TH concentration involves also an additional level of regulation, namely the hormonal transport through the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) (Williams, 2008). The TRH and the TSH are actually regulating the production of pro-hormone T4 and in a lesser extent of T3, which is the biologically active TH. The rest of the required amount of T3 is produced by outer ring deiodination of T4 by the deiodinating enzymes D1 and D2 (Bianco et al., 2006), a process which takes place mainly in liver and kidneys but also in other target organs such as in the brain, the anterior pituitary, brown adipose tissue, thyroid and skeletal muscle (Gereben et al., 2008; Larsen, 2009). Both hormones exert their action in almost all tissues of mammals and they are acting intracellularly, and thus the uptake of T3 and T4 by the target cells is a crucial step of the overall pathway. The trans-membrane transport of TH is performed mainly through transporters that differ depending on the cell type (Hennemann et al., 2001; Friesema et al., 2005; Visser et al., 2008). Many transporter proteins have been identified up to date but the monocarboxylate transporters (Mct8, Mct10) and the anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP1c1) show the highest degree of affinity towards TH (Jansen et al., 2005).

T3 and T4 have significant effects on normal development, neural differentiation, growth rate and metabolism (Yen, 2001; Brent, 2012; Williams, 2008), with the most prominent ones to occur during the fetal development and early childhood. The clinical features of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism emphasize the pleiotropic effects of these hormones on many different pathways and target organs. The thyroidal actions though are not only restricted to mammals, as their high significance has been identified also for other vertebrates, with the most well-studied to be the amphibian metamorphosis (Furlow and Neff, 2006). The importance of the thyroid-regulated pathways becomes more apparent in iodine deficient areas of the world, where a higher rate of cretinism and growth retardation has been observed and linked to decreased TH levels (Gilbert et al., 2012). Another very common cause of severe hypothyroidism in human is the congenital hypothyroidism, but the manifestation of these effects is only detectable in the lack of adequate treatment and is mainly related to neurological impairment and growth retardation (Glinoer, 2001), emphasizing the role of TH in neurodevelopment in all above cases. In adults, the thyroid-related effects are mainly linked to metabolic activities, such as deficiencies in oxygen consumption, and in the metabolism of the vitamin, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates, but these defects are subtle and reversible (Oetting and Yen, 2007). Blood tests to detect the amount of thyroid hormone (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are routinely done for newborn babies for the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism at the earliest stage possible.
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""T3 and T4 can be measured as free (unbound) or total (bound + unbound). Free hormone are considered more direct indicators of T4 and T3 activities in the body. The majority of T3 and T4 measurements are made using either RIA or ELISA kits. In animal studies, total T3 and T4 are typically measured as the concentrations of free hormone are very low and difficult to detect. Historically, the most widely used method in toxicology is RIA. The method is routinely used in rodent endocrine and toxicity studies. The ELISA method has become more routine in rodent studies. The ELISA method is a commonly used as a human clinical test method. Least common is analytical determination of iodothyronines (T3, T4, rT3, T2) and their conjugates, though methods employing HLPC and mass spectrometry (DeVito et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2009).

Any of these measurements should be evaluated for fit-for-purpose, relationship to the actual endpoint of interest, repeatability, and reproducibility. All three of the methods summarized above would be fit-for-purpose, depending on the number of samples to be evaluated and the associated costs of each method. Both RIA and ELISA measure THs by a an indirect methodology, whereas analytical determination is the most direct measurement available. All of these methods, particularly RIA, are repeatable and reproducible.

A second assay is a chromatography-based method coupled to mass spectroscopy to measure products of thyroxin by deiodinase type-1 activity (Butt et al., 2010). Finally, a colorimetric method was developed (Renko et al., 2012) that measures the release of iodine from T4. 
Although the radioactive based assays uses radioactivity to measure deiodinase activity, they provide a good balance between specificity and  resources needed. The chromatography-based assay has a high sensitivity and specificity to measure all thyroid hormones metabolites, but a high degree of technical expertise and expensive instrumentation is required. Although the colorimetric method is a promising alternative, the sensitivity of this assay is still limited.
For all the reasons above, we chose to use the radioactive method. Since DIO1 and DIO2 prefer a different substrate to deiodinate, i.e. rT3 and T4 respectively, it is possible to quantify outer-ring deiodination using the specific enzymkinetics of both enzymes. This assay measures the amount of  radioactive iodine that is released from 125I-labelled substrates by conversion of one of the substrates by the DIO enzymes. We used a pig liver homogenate preparation and  reaction buffers containing DTT as co-substrate. Furthermore, a concentration range of potential thyroid-disrupting chemicals can be added to measure the inhibitory potencies of the chemicals the inhibit DIO enzyme activity. Enzym activity is expressed as picomoles or femtomoles of released radioactive iodine per minute per mg protein and if inhibition occurs, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined.

	dcterms:description	"""Background

The human lung with the surface area of ~100 m2 is ventilated by 10-20,000 litres of air per day. Thus, it is the largest organ of the human body that is exposed to the environment contaminated with pathogens, organic and inorganic materials. The gas exchange between blood and the inhaled air takes place across a membrane that is only 1-2 &micro;m thick, making the lung an easy target for foreign invasion and toxic chemicals in the environment. To combat the constant attack by the pathogens and chemicals, the lung is equipped with several defence mechanisms; a layer of epithelial cells acting as physical barrier to limit entry of pathogens and specialised cells of the immune system with defence functions (reviewed in Weitnauer M et al., 2016). The human lung consists of approximately 40 different resident cell types that play different roles during homeostasis, injury, repair, and disease states (Franks TJ et al., 2008). Of these cells, resident airway epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and dendritic cells are well characterised for their ability to sense the danger upon interaction with harmful substances and relay the message to mount the necessary immune/inflammatory response.

Receptor-mediated interactions

The chemicals or pathogens interact with cellular membrane to gain access to the organisms&rsquo; interior. This interaction between the pathogens/substances and lung cells can occur via binding of the pathogens or pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs, microbial molecules) to the receptors present on the surfaces of the resident cells. For example, the airway epithelium and the mucosal layer form a physical barrier and contribute to the first line of defence. The resident epithelial cells, by default, under the normal homeostatic conditions, are adjusted to the local microbial burden and therefore, are less responsive to microbial stimulation. The resident epithelial cell surfaces express receptors that recognise and sense the presence of pathogens through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) resulting in epithelial cell activation. PRRs are also present on other resident cells including alveolar macrophages. PRRs can be activated by interaction with debris from dying cells (cellular fragments) as a result of interaction with toxic substances. Engagement of PRRs and consequent cell activation is observed in various organisms including flies and mammals (Matzinger, 2002).

Opsonisation driven interactions

In case of non-pathogens such as insoluble particles or engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), interaction with cellular membrane can occur via the process of opsonisation. For example, the surfaces of ENMs can be adsorbed with opsonins (protein corona) such as immunoglobulins, complement proteins, or serum proteins that are then recognised by the phagocytes (macrophages). Opsonised ENMs attach to the cellular membrane of phagocytes via ligand-receptor interactions. Some of the receptors on the cell surface that are engaged by the opsonins include Fc receptors and complement protein receptors (reviewed in Behzadi S et al., 2017). The endocytosis processes such as phagocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolin-mediated endocytosis, and micropinocytosis define the interactions between cell membrane and the particles (airborne or ENMs).

Physical or mechanical interactions

The other type of interaction can involve physical damage to cells. High aspect ratio (HAR) materials such as asbestos or CNTs can pierce the cellular membrane of epithelial cells or resident macrophages resulting in cell injury or non-programmed cellular death. The resident macrophages are present in all tissues, and in a steady state, contribute to epithelial integrity, survey the tissue for invading pathogens or chemicals and maintain an immunosuppressive environment. Their main function is to clear the incoming irritants and microbes. They are named differently based on the tissue type and their specific functions. Resident macrophages in the lung, bone, brain, liver, spleen, skin, and in the intestine are known as alveolar macrophages, osteoclasts, microglia, Kupffer cells, splenic macrophages, Langerhans cells and intestinal macrophages, respectively (Kierdorf K et al., 2015). It has been shown that alveolar macrophages trying to engulf HARs including asbestos and CNTs that are long and stiff undergo frustrated phagocytosis because of their inability to engulf the piercing fibres and subsequently lead to cell injury (Mossman BT et al., 1998; Donaldson K et al., 2010).

	mmo:0000000	"""Detection of Danger Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) or homeostasis-altering molecular processes (HAMPs)

Cellular interaction with substances or particles can be measured by assessing the release of DAMPs from stressed, injured or dying cells or activation of TLR receptors - indicative of binding of PAMPs to the cell surface. Release of DAMPs is reflective of substance interaction with resident cells and their activation, a key step in the process of inflammation. DAMPs, also called as alarmins are endogenous molecules that are released by stressed cells. A few of the putative alarmins that can be effectively measured in biological samples including cultured cells are High Mobility Group Binding 1 (HMGB1) protein, Heat Shock proteins (HSPs), uric acid, annexins, S100 proteins and IL-1&alpha; (Bianchi ME, 2007).

Of all, IL-1a is the most commonly measured alarmin. IL-1a is the principal pro-inflammatory moiety and is a designated &lsquo;alarmin&rsquo; in the cell that alerts the host to injury or damage (Di Paolo NC, 2016). It is shown that administration of necrotic cells to mice results in neutrophilic inflammation that was entirely mediated by IL-1a released from the dying or necrosed cells and consequent activation of IL-1 Receptor 1 (IL-1R1) signalling (Suwaraa MI et al., 2014). IL-1a is released following exposure to MWCNTs (Nikota J et al., 2017) and silica (Rabolli V et al., 2014). IL-1a can be cleaved from its precursor form to the active form; however, it is not a prerequisite since both precursor and cleaved forms of IL-1a are active that bind and activate IL-1R1 signaling.

The release of DAMPs can be measured by the techniques listed below.

Targeted enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (routinely used and recommended)

ELISA assays &ndash; permit quantitative measurement of antigens in biological samples. For example, in a cytokine ELISA (sandwich ELISA), an antibody (capture antibody) specific to a cytokine is immobilised on microtitre wells (96-well, 386-well, etc.). Experimental samples or samples containing a known amount of the specific recombinant cytokine are then reacted with the immobilised antibody. Following removal of unbound antibody by thorough washing, plates are reacted with the secondary antibody (detection antibody) that is conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase, which when bound, will form a sandwich with the capture antibody and the cytokine (Amsen D et al., 2009). The secondary antibody can be conjugated to biotin, which is then detected by addition of streptavidin linked to horseradish peroxidase. A chromogenic substrate can also be added, which is the most commonly used method. Chromogenic substrate is chemically converted by the enzyme coupled to the detection antibody, resulting in colour change. The amount of colour detected is directly proportional to the amount of cytokine in the sample that is bound to the capture antibody. The results are read using a spectrophotometer and compared to the levels of cytokine in control samples where cytokine is not expected to be secreted or to the samples containing known recombinant cytokine levels.

IL-1a is activated or secreted into the cytosol following stimulus. Targeted ELISA for IL-1a can be used to quantify IL-1a that is released in the culture supernatant of the cells exposed to toxicants, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum of exposed animals. The assay is also applicable to human serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and peritoneal fluids.

Similarly, other alarmins can also be quantified by ELISA. Westernblot is another method that can be used to quantify the release of various alarmins using specific antibodies. qRT-PCR or ELISA assays can also be used to quantify expression of genes or proteins that are regulated by the receptor binding &ndash; e.g. downstream of TLR binding.

Measuring cellular uptake of ENMs 

Lysosomal localisation &ndash; In vitro, interaction of ENMs with the cellular membrane can be investigated by assessing their uptake by the lysosomes (Varela JA et al., 2012). Immunohistochemistry methods targeting lysosome specific proteins are regularly employed for this purpose. In co-localisation experiments, lysosomal marker LAMP1 antibody is used to detect particle co-localisation with lysosomes. A combination of Cytoviva hyperspectral microscope and immunolocalisation (Decan N et al., 2016) or confocal microscopy to visualise co-localisation of fluorescence labelled nanoparticles with lysosomal markers have been used.

	dc:source	"AOPWiki" ;
	dcterms:description	"""Proinflammatory mediators are the chemical and biological molecules that initiate and regulate inflammatory reactions. Cell-derived proinflammatory mediators include cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Blood derived proinflammatory mediators include vasoactive amines, complement activation products and others. These modulators can be grouped based on the cell type that secrete them, their cellular localisation and also based on the type of immune response they trigger. For example, members of the interleukin family including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, IL-21, IL-3, IL-5 and GM-CSF are involved in the adaptive immune responses. Some of the proinflammatory cytokines include IL-1 family (IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-1ra, IL-18, IL-36a, IL-36b, IL-36g, IL-36Ra, IL-37), IL-6 family, TNF family, IL-17, and IFNg (Turner MD et al., 2014). While IL-4 and IL-5 are considered T helper (Th) cell type 2 response, IFNg is suggested to be Th1 type response.

Different types of proinflammatory mediators are secreted during innate or adaptive immune responses across various species (Mestas J et al., 2004). However, IL-1 family cytokines, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, TNFa, IFNg are the commonly measured mediators in experimental animal models and in humans. Proinflammatory mediators are secreted following exposure to an inflammogen in a gender/sex or developmental stage independent manner.

Several studies show increased proinflammatory mediators in rodent lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and in cell culture supernatants following exposure to a variety of CNT types and other fibrogenic materials. Exposure to crystalline silica induces release of inflammatory cytokines (TNFa, IL-1, IL-6), transcription factors (NF-kb, AP-1) and kinase signalling pathways in mice that contain NFkB luciferase reporter (Hubbard AK, 2002). Long and thin CNTs (&gt;5 &micro;m) can elicit asbestos-like pathogenicity through the continual release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS (Poland CA, 2008). Lung responses to long MWCNTs included high expression levels of MCP-1, TGF-&beta;1, and TNF-&alpha; (Boyles MSP, 2015). In vitro, CNTs have been shown to induce increased secretion of cytokines and chemokines (He X, 2011; Herano S, 2010). 
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""The selection of proinflammatory mediators for investigation varies based on the expertise of the lab, cell type studied and availability of the specific antibodies.

qRT-PCR &ndash; will measure the abundance of cytokine mRNA in a given sample. The method involves three steps: conversion of RNA into cDNA by reverse transcription method, amplification of cDNA using the PCR, and the real-time detection and quantification of amplified products (amplicons) (Nolan T et al., 2006). Amplicons are detected using fluorescence, increase in which is directly proportional to the amplified PCR product. The number of cycles required per sample to reach a certain threshold of fluorescence (set by the user &ndash; usually set in the linear phase of the amplification, and the observed difference in samples to cross the set threshold reflects the initial amount available for amplification) is used to quantify the relative amount in the samples. The amplified products are detected by the DNA intercalating minor groove-binding flourophore SYBR green, which produces a signal when incorporated into double-stranded amplicons. Since the cDNA is single stranded, the dye does not bind enhancing the specificity of the results. There are other methods such as nested fluorescent probes for detection but SYBR green is widely used. RT-PCR primers specific to several proinflammatory mediators in several species including mouse, rat and humans, are readily available commercially.

ELISA assays &ndash; permit quantitative measurement of antigens in biological samples. For example, in a cytokine ELISA (sandwich ELISA), an antibody (capture antibody) specific to a cytokine is immobilised on microtitre wells (96-well, 386-well, etc.). Experimental samples or samples containing a known amount of the specific recombinant cytokine are then reacted with the immobilised antibody. Following removal of unbound antibody by thorough washing, plates are reacted with the secondary antibody (detection antibody) that is conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase, which when bound, will form a sandwich with the capture antibody and the cytokine (Amsen D et al., 2009). The secondary antibody can be conjugated to biotin, which is then detected by addition of streptavidin linked to horseradish peroxidase. A chromogenic substrate can also be added, which is the most commonly used method. Chromogenic substrate is chemically converted by the enzyme coupled to the detection antibody, resulting in colour change. The amount of colour detected is directly proportional to the amount of cytokine in the sample that is bound to the capture antibody. The results are read using a spectrophotometer and compared to the levels of cytokine in control samples where cytokine is not expected to be secreted or to the samples containing known recombinant cytokine levels.

Both ELISA and qRT-PCR assays are readily applicable to in vitro cell culture models, where cell culture supernatants or whole cell homogenates are used for ELISA or mRNA assays. Both assays are straight forward, quantitative and require relatively a small amount of input sample.

Apart from assaying single protein or gene at a time, cytokine bead arrays or cytokine PCR arrays can also be used to detect a whole panel of inflammatory mediators in a multiplex method (Husain M et al., 2015). This method is quantitative and especially advantageous when the sample amount available for testing is scarce. Lastly, immunohistochemistry can also be used to detect specific immune cell types producing the proinflammatory mediators and its downstream effectors in any given tissue (Costa PM et al., 2017). Immunohistochemistry results can be used as weight of evidence; however, the technique is not quantitative and depending on the specific antibodies used, the assay sensitivity may also become an issue (Amsen D et al., 2009).

	dcterms:description	"""Proinflammatory cells originate in bone marrow and are recruited to the site of infection or injury via circulation following specific proinflammatory mediator (cytokine and chemokine) signalling. Proinflammatory cells are recruited to lungs to clear the invading pathogen or the toxic substance. Monocytes (dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils) are subsets of circulating white blood cells that are involved in the immune responses to pathogen or toxicant stimuli. They are derived from the bone marrow. They can differentiate into different macrophage types and dendritic cells. They can be categorised based on their size, the type of cell surface receptors and their ability to differentiate following external or internal stimulus such as increased expression of cytokines. Monocytes participate in tissue healing, clearance of toxic substance or pathogens, and in the initiation of adaptive immunity. Recruited monocytes can also influence pathogenesis (Ingersoll MA et al., 2011). Sensing or recognition of pathogens and harmful substances results in the recruitment of monocytes to lungs (Shi C and Pamer EG, 2011).

Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and they stimulate na&iuml;ve T-cell proliferation. They are found in the airway epithelium, the alveolar septa, pulmonary capillaries and airway spaces. APCs identify, ingest and process an antigen and present the antigen to resident T-cells in the lymph node initiating the immune response (Kopf M et al., 2015).

Macrophages are the components of mononuclear phagocyte system; they phagocytose pathogens, nanoparticles and other cellular debris. Mononuclear phagocytes originate in bone marrow as blood monocytes, which migrate to different tissues where they differentiate into tissue macrophages. At least three types of macrophages exist in lung: bronchial macrophages, interstitial macrophages and alveolar macrophages. They are found in the air space of the alveoli, parenchymal space (interstitial space) between adjacent alveoli. Lung macrophages can be characterised by their expression of surface markers. Activated macrophages release a variety of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors (Kopf M et al., 2015).

Neutrophils are a type of polymorphonuclear leukocytes that are among the first to be recruited to an injured or inflamed site and play a major role in acute inflammation. They are the fundamental effectors of the host immune system and their basic role is to clear the infection or exogenous agents causing tissue injury. Neutrophils are continuously generated in the bone marrow and can be found in spleen, liver and lung. The lung holds a large reservoir of mature, terminally differentiated neutrophils, which are patrolling within the lung vasculature during steady state conditions (Kolaczkowska E and Kubes P, 2013). Neutrophil recruitment is initiated by the changes in the endothelium surface following stimulation by alarmin, DAMPs or inflammatory mediators released from resident leukocytes when they come in contact with pathogens or injurious external stimuli.

Eosinophils are a type of white blood cells and a type of granulocytes (contain granules and enzymes) that are recruited following exposure to allergens, during allergic reactions such as asthma or during allergen induced fibrosis.

Activated immune cells secrete a variety of proinflammatory mediators, the purpose of which is to propagate the immune signalling and response, which when not controlled, lead to chronic inflammation, extensive cellular death and tissue injury.

It is important to note that the stressor-induced MIE, KE1 and KE2 are part of the functional changes that we collectively considered as inflammation, and together, they mark the initiation of acute inflammation phase.

	mmo:0000000	"""In vivo, recruitment of proinflammatory cells is measured using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cellularity assay.

The airway epithelium is the largest surface that is targeted by inhaled substances including ENMs. The fluid lining the epithelium (BAL fluid) is lavaged and its composition is assessed as marker of lung immune response to the toxic substances or pathogens. BAL is assessed quantitatively for types of infiltrating cells, levels and types of cytokines and chemokines. Thus, BAL fluid assessment can aid in developing dose-response of a substance, to rank a substances&rsquo; potency and to set up no effect level of exposure for regulatory purposes. For ENMs, in vivo BAL assessment is recommended as a mandatory test (discussed in ENV/JM/MONO(2012)40 and also in OECD inhalation TG for ENMs). Temporal changes in the BAL composition can be prognostic of initiation and progression of lung immune disease (Cho W-S et al., 2010).

In vitro, it is difficult to assess the recruitment of proinflammatory cells. Thus, a suit of proinflammatory mediators specific to cell types are assessed using the same techniques mentioned above (qRT-PCR, ELISA, immunohistochemistry) in cell culture models, as indicative of recruitment of cells into the lungs.

	dcterms:description	"""Loss of alveolar capillary membrane integrity

The alveolar-capillary membrane (ACM) is the gas exchange surface of the lungs that is only ~0.3&micro;m thick and is the largest surface area within the lung that separates the interior of the body from the environment. It is comprised of the microvascular endothelium, interstitium, and alveolar epithelium. The cellular composition of ACM includes the type 1 alveolar epithelial cells, the capillary endothelial cells, and the endothelial and epithelial basement membranes. As a consequence of its anatomical position, and the large surface area, it is the first point of contact for any inhaled pathogens, particles or toxic substances. Thus, ACM is subjected to injury and rapidly repaired following the external insults without formation of fibrosis or scar tissue. The extent of ACM injury or how rapidly its integrity is restored is a pivotal determinant of whether the lung restores its normal functioning following an injury or is replaced by fibrotic lesion or scar tissue. Repeated exposure to or biopersistent toxic substances, pathogens or lung irritants leading to non-resolving inflammation contribute to the ACM injury. Chronic inflammation mediated by overexpression of cytokines such as IL-1, TGFb, T-helper type 2 cytokine IL-13 or exposure to specific proteinases initiate ACM injury leading to significant loss of the epithelium and endothelium of the ACM resulting in loss of the barrier. In patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, both type 1 pneumocyte and endothelial cell injury with the ACM barrier loss is observed. In addition, in normal conditions, the epithelial barrier consisting of alveolar epithelial type 1 and type 2 cells establish close contacts with the neighbouring cells via cell-cell adhesions through the intercellular junction complexes such as tight junctions, adherens junction and desmosomes (Vareille M et al., 2011; Kulkarni T et al., 2016). The various proteins found at the epithelial cell surface play a role in maintaining the cellular adhesions and intercellular junction complexes, which are critical for maintaining the integrity of alveolar epithelium. Exposure to pro-fibrotic drug bleomycin destroys structural architecture of the tight junctions leading to increased&nbsp; permeability, epithelial death and loss of specialised proteins such as caludins required for repair and restoration of alveolar epithelial barrier. Thoracic radiation and bleomycin-induced lung injury result in decreased expression of E-cadherin and Aquaporin-5 expression &ndash; proteins involved in adherens and in transgenic mice lacking aquaporin-5, increased lung fibrosis is observed. Increased membrane permeability leading to efflux of protein-rich fluid into the peribronchovascular interstitium and the distal airspaces of the lung, disruption of normal fluid transport via downregulated Na channels or malfunctioning Na+/K+ATPase pumps, loss of surfactant production, increased expression of epithelial or endothelial cell markers such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) or decreased expression of surfactant D are few of the markers of decreasing lung compliance arising from the lost integrity of ACM (Johnson ER et al., 2010).

Alveolar capillary membrane integrity loss is also associated with other events such as chronic inflammation and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) synthesis. Chronic inflammation and ROS synthesis are described below as associative events to ACM loss.

Chronic inflammation as an associative event in the loss of ACM

Chronic inflammation, by definition is associated with tissue injury (Wallace WA et al., 2007). In the presence of continuous stimulus (e.g., presence of biopersistent toxic fibres such as asbestos, multi walled carbon nanotubes) or following repeated stimulus (e.g., repeated exposure to silica or coal dust), the ensuing tissue injury fuels the inflammatory mechanisms leading to accumulation of immune cells, prolonged inflammation and aggravated tissue damage. This sustained and perpetuated immunological response is termed as chronic inflammation. The chronicity of the inflammatory process occurs after prolonged acute inflammation and is a crucial component of the lung fibrotic response. During the chronic inflammatory phase, active inflammation, tissue injury and destruction, and tissue repair processes proceed in tandem. Thus, the causative substance must contain unique physico-chemical properties that grant the material biopersistance in the pulmonary environment or the pulmonary system has to be repeatedly exposed to the same substance that perpetuates the tissue injury.

Although, increases in number of neutrophils are observed during chronic inflammation, mononuclear phagocytes (circulating monocytes, tissue macrophages) and lymphoid cells mark this phase. The macrophages, components of mononuclear phagocyte system, are the predominant cells in chronic inflammation. Macrophages are the key inflammatory cells linking inflammation with repair and fibrosis. Activated macrophages release a variety of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, which when uncontrolled, lead to extensive tissue injury, cellular death and necrosis, the other characteristics of chronic inflammation. The other types of inflammatory cells found in chronic inflammation include eosinophils in allergen induced lung fibrosis, lymphocytes and epithelial cells.

Oxidative stress as an associative event in the ACM loss 

Oxidative stress is an important event that influences the extent of lung injury (reviewed in MacNee W, 2001). Superoxide anion (O2-) and the hydroxyl radical (OH) are the common ROS found in the biological systems that are unstable due to unpaired electrons. ROS, when interacted with biomolecules, initiate their oxidation. As such, all tissues including lung have efficient antioxidant system to counteract the ROS induced oxidation. The antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase act directly to inactivate ROS and associated reactions. In addition, phase II detoxifying enzymes, including glutathione-S-transferase, NADPH quinone oxidoreductase and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic act as indirect antioxidant enzymes. However, when the balance between oxidant and antioxidants is tipped towards oxidants, oxidative stress occurs. During the process, proteins, DNA and lipids are oxidized. Oxidative stress modulates the cellular signalling processes and contributes to oxidative stress-induced tissue injury. It also plays a role in the tissue injury caused by inflammatory processes in lungs. The infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages generate superoxide anion which is converted to hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutase enzyme. OH is formed by a secondary reaction in the presence of Fe2+. ROS can also be produced by NADPH oxidase present in phagocytes. The other enzyme that contributes to ROS synthesis during inflammatory processes is the myeloperoxidase from neutrophils.&nbsp; In a self-perpetuating loop, inflammatory cells generate oxidative stress leading to increased airspace epithelial permeability, increased cell death and increased expression of proinflammatory genes, all of which lead to secretion of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines leading to prolonged and chronic inflammation. Nrf2, a member of the cap&rsquo;n&rsquo;collar basic leucine zipper transcription factors is suggested to play an important role in orchestrating the antioxidant defence against ROS via antioxidant response element. Nrf2 is shown to be protective against pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis induced by oxidants (Kikuchi N et al., 2010).

Human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is suggested to result from increased ROS synthesis and imbalances in oxidant/antioxidant levels in distal alveolar space. Antioxidant treatment of mice attenuates bleomycin-induced oxidative stress and subsequent lung fibrosis (Wang HD, 2002). Several ENMs have been shown to induce oxidative stress (a state of redox disequilibrium), an event associated with their in vivo toxicity (Xia T, 2008). Bleomycin induced lung pathology involves oxidative stress. In mice treated with antioxidants, bleomycin-induced inflammation and pathology is attenuated (Kelly C, 2008).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""Proteinosis, BAL fluid protein content

The compromised ACM integrity in vivo can be measured by measuring total protein or total albumin content in the BAL fluid derived from experimental animals exposed to lung toxicants or in human patients suffering from lung fibrosis. In addition to albumin, the total urea in BAL fluid is also a good indicator of the ACM integrity loss (Schmekel B et al., 1992).

The physical-chemical properties of chemicals, their intended applications and exposure levels must be considered as important factors influencing the extent of lung injury. Although not quantitative, in case of ENMs, the physical presence of ENMs (biopersistence) must be confirmed in lungs following exposure, using Transmission Electron Microscopy or Cytoviva Nanoscale Hyperspectral Microscope. High aspect ratio materials including ENMs injure the ACM in rodent models.

Cell type considerations

In vitro, assays with human cells are desired; however, the use of cells derived from experimental animals including alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, epithelial cells, and neutrophils are routinely used. Primary cells are preferred over immortalised cell types that are in culture for a long period of time.

Cellular damage

Upon interaction with toxic substances, phagocytic cells internalize toxic substances leading to respiratory burst and release of ROS. A fluorimetric assay that relies on the intracellular oxidation of 5- and 6-carboxy-2&rsquo;,7&rsquo;-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy H2DCFDA) (Molecular Probes) has been used to detect ROS release in cells in vitro (Decan et al., 2016); however, it is important to note that the results are not specific to the types of radicals detected. In addition, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and protein carbonylation can be measured as indicative of oxidative stress using proteomics techniques (Riebeling et al., 2001). Measurement of intracellular glutathione levels using the ThiolTracker&trade; Violet assay (Decan et al., 2016) or glutathionylation of proteins is also used. Oxidative stress can also be measured by assessing the relevant genes and proteins associated with antioxidant pathways (Riebeling et al., 2001). Other biomolecule modifications such as nitrosylation, reflective of oxidative stress, can be measured by measuring nitrosylated tissue proteins, or increase in NO production, and nitrate/nitrite ratio in BAL. In addition to tissue analysis, acellular glutathione levels, antioxidants and NO production in BAL supernatant can be used to assess ROS synthesis. These methods have been routinely used to measure ROS release following exposures to several toxic substances including ENMs.

Cytotoxicity assessment

Cellular viability or cytotoxicity assays are the most commonly used endpoints to assess the leaky or compromised cell membrane. The most commonly employed method is the trypan blue exclusion assay &ndash; a dye exclusion assay where cells with intact membrane do not permit entry of the dye into cells and thus remain clear, whereas the dye diffuses into cells with damaged membrane turning them to blue colour. Other high throughput assays that use fluorescent DNA stains such as ethidium bromide or propidium iodide can also be used and cells that have incorporated the dye can be scored using flow cytometry.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay is a very sensitive cytotoxicity assay that measures the amount of LDH released in the media following membrane injury. The assay is based on measuring the reduction of NAD and conversion of a tetrazolium dye that is measured at a wavelength of 490 nm.

The Calcein AM assay depends on the hydrolysis of calcein AM ( a non-fluorescent hydrophobic compound that permeates live cells by simple diffusion) by non-specific intracellular esterases resulting in production of calcein, a hydrophilic and strongly fluorescent compound that is readily released into the cell culture media by the damaged cells.

Although the above mentioned assays work for almost all chemicals, insoluble substances such as ENMs can confound the assays by inhibiting the enzyme activity or interfering with the absorbance reading. Thus, care must be taken to include appropriate controls in the assay.

Transepithelial/transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER)

TEER is an accepted quantitative technique that measures the integrity of tight junctions in cell culture models of endothelial and epithelial cell monolayers. They are based on measuring ohmic resistance or measuring impedance across a wide range of frequencies.

The other methods include targeted qRT-PCR or ELISA assays for tight junction proteins, cell adhesion molecules and inflammatory mediators such as IFNg, IL-10, and IL-13.&nbsp;&nbsp;

	dcterms:alternative	"Activation of Th2 cells" ;
	dc:source	"AOPWiki" ;
	dcterms:description	"""How does this KE work

The loss of ACM involving epithelial cell injury engages the adaptive immune system resulting in the activation of CD4+ T cells.&nbsp; Na&iuml;ve CD4+ T cells differentiate into four types of Th cells &ndash; Th1, Th2, Th17 and inducible regulatory T cells following exposure to infectious agents. The differentiation process begins when antigen presenting cells (APCs) come in contact with toxic substances and is mainly driven by cytokines that make up the microenvironment. For example, increased concentrations of IL-12 secreted by APCs in the environment may be biased towards Th1 type and increased IL-6 or IL-4 in the environment may commit to Th2 type differentiation (Kidd P, 2003). As described above, the major sources of Th2 cytokines are Th2 cells themselves; however, mast cells, macrophages, epithelial cells and activated fibroblasts have shown to produce IL-4, IL-13 and IL-10 upon appropriate stimulation (Lukacs NW. et al., 2001). For fibroplasia or fibrosis, the type of CD4+ T cell response that develops is crucial. Studies conducted in mice that do not express Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 have shown complete attenuation of fibrosis despite the highly active Th1 response, clearly demonstrating the link between Th2 response and fibrosis. Th1 cytokines IFNg and IL-12 induce inflammation, aid in clearance of toxic substances, induce tissue damage and control the fibrotic responses. IFNg has suppressive effects on the production of extracellular matrix proteins including collagen and fibronectin. In animal models of fibrosis, overexpression of IFNg negatively regulates fibrotic process. On the other hand, Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 regulate wound healing and contribute to the development and extension of fibrosis. IL-4 and IL-13 are suggested to stimulate the production of extracellular matrix proteins by activated fibroblasts; overexpression of IL-4 or IL-13 in fibroblasts increases ECM deposition. The Th2 response suppresses Th1 mediated response, which results in decreased Th1 cell-mediated tissue damage but at the same time contributing to the persistence of toxic substances leading to perpetuation of tissue damage, triggering uncontrolled healing response.&nbsp; Neutrophils recruitment during acute inflammation initiates Th2 immune response and secretion of Th2 type cytokines and chemokines (Lekkerkerker N, 2014). The members of the FIZZ (resistin-like molecules, RELM) proteins is induced in lung airway and epithelial cells following exposure to fibrogenic bleomycin (Liu T, 2004; Liu T, 2014).&nbsp; The expression of FIZZ is shown to be mediated by Th2 signalling and is involved in recruitment of inflammatory cells to lungs (Nair 2003; Munitz 2008; Angelini 2010; Madala 2012).

Macrophage polarisation as an associative event in the activation of Th2 cells

Depending on the lung microenvironment (damaged cells, microbial products, activated lymphocytes), the precursor monocytes differentiate into distinct types of macrophages. Classically activated (M1) macrophages and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages are the important ones to consider in the context of this AOP. The M1 macrophages produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mediate resistance to pathogens, induce generation of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and induce T helper (Th) 1 type responses. M1 macrophages produce IL-1, IL-12, IL-23 and induce Th1 cell infiltration and activation. M1 macrophages are associated with antigen presentation, microbiocidal and antitumour activities. The M2 macrophages secrete anti-inflammatory mediators, by which they play a role in regulation of inflammation. The M2 polarisation is mediated by Th2 cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-13, which in turn, promotes M2 activation. M2 macrophages express immunosuppressive molecules such as IL-10, Arginase-1 and -2 (Arg-1, Arg-2), which suppress the induction of Th1 cells that produce the anti-fibrotic cytokine IFNg. The activity of M2 is associated with tissue remodelling, immune regulation, tumour promotion, tissue regeneration and effective phagocytic activity (Martinez FO and Gordon S, 2014). During chronic inflammation, the phenotype of infiltrating macrophages is suggested to resemble that of M2, which is suggested to play a role in lung fibrosis.

Pharyngeal aspiration of MWCNT for 7 days in mice induced lung fibrosis via activation of Th2 cells and Th2- mediated immune response, and included increased expression of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13 and other genes. In addition, activation of Th2-mediated signaling pathway involving STAT6 transcription factor was also observed (Dong J and Ma Q, 2016). Meta-analysis of gene expression data derived from lungs of mice exposed to MWCNTs showed that the MWCNT-induced gene expression profiles are similar to the expression profiles induced in Th2 signalling-mediated lung fibrosis (Nikota J, 2016). In another study, mice deficient in STAT6 transcription factor showed attenuated lung fibrosis following exposure MWCNT, that was accompanied by reduced expression of Th2 cytokines and chemokines (Nikota J, 2017). Polarisation to Th2 and M2 phenotypes is observed in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (Li D, 2014).

	mmo:0000000	"""Targeted enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (routinely used and recommended)

The ELISA and qRT-PCR are routinely used to assess the levels of protein and mRNA of several Th1 and Th2 cytokines including IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-10, IL-12, IFNg. In addition, the levels of Transforming growth factor b (TGFb) is also assessed, expression of which is increased following induction of IL-13 synthesis. The other genes of relevance to Th2 response and eventual pro-fibrotic response include FIZZ-1, Arg-1 and Arg-2. BALF supernatant collected from lungs of animals exposed to toxic substances or human patients is used. Tissue homogenates or cell pellets can also be used. Expression of these genes and proteins can be assessed in in vitro cell cultures exposed to pro-fibrotic stimulus.

Apart from assaying single protein or gene at a time, cytokine bead arrays or cytokine PCR arrays can be used to detect a whole panel of Th1 and/or Th2 cytokines using a multiplex method. This method is quantitative and especially advantageous when the sample amount available for testing is scarce.

The details of ELISA and qRT-PCR are described under MIE. The details of BALF sample collection is described under KE2.

	dcterms:description	"""Fibroblasts are non-hematopoietic, non-epithelial and non-endothelial cells. In steady state conditions, they are distributed throughout the mesenchyme (Phan SH, 2008). During the wound healing process, fibroblasts are rapidly recruited from mesenchymal cells or in case of exaggerated repair, and they can also be derived from fibrocytes in the bone marrow. They are not terminally differentiated. Fibroblasts are the workhorse of the connective tissue that joins and holds other tissues together in the body. They synthesise structural proteins (fibrous collagen, elastin), adhesive proteins (laminin and fibronectins) and ground substance (glycosaminoglycans &ndash; hyaluronan and glycoproteins) proteins of the ECM that provide structural support to tissue architecture and function. In the context of lung fibrosis, fibroblasts play an important role in ECM maintenance and turnover, wound healing, inflammation and angiogenesis (Kendall RT, 2014). They provide structural integrity to the newly formed wound. Fibroblasts with a-smooth muscle actin expression are called myofibroblasts. It is thought that differentiating fibroblasts residing in the lung are the primary source of myofibroblast (CD45- Col I+ &alpha;-SMA+) cells (Hashimoto et al 2001; Serini and Gabbiani 1999). Myofibroblasts can also originate from epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Kim et al 2006). The other sources of fibroblasts include fibrocytes that likely originate in the bone marrow and migrate to the site of injury upon cytokine signaling. Fibrocytes are capable of differentiating into fibroblasts or myofibroblasts, and comprise less than 1% of the circulating pool of leukocytes and express chemokines CCR2, CXCR4 and CCR7 in addition to a characteristic pattern of biomarkers, including collagen I and III, CD34, CD43 and CD45 (Bucala et al 1994; Chesney et al 1998; Abe et al 2001).&nbsp; In bleomycin induced lung fibrosis model, human CD34+ CD45+ collagen I CXCR4+ cells (fibrocytes) are shown to migrate to the lungs in response to both bleomycin and CXCL12 (CXCL12 binds to CXCR4) (Phillip et al., 2004). Myofibroblasts exhibit features of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. The myofibroblasts synthesise and deposit ECM components that eventually replace the provisional ECM. Because of their contractile properties, they play a major role in contraction and closure of the wound tissue[SH1]&nbsp;. Apart from secreting ECM components, myofibroblasts also secrete proteolytic enzymes such as metalloproteinases and their inhibitors tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, which play a role in the final phase of the wound healing which is scar formation phase or tissue remodelling.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a process by which epithelial cells lose their original phenotype, acquire fibroblast-like properties, and display reduced cell adhesion (which is crucial for the detachment of epithelial cells prior to migration to the site of injury) and increased motility (Lekkerkerker et al 2012). During this process, epithelial cells also lose typical markers such as E-cadherin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and acquire mesenchymal markers such as fibroblast-specific protein-1, vimentin and &alpha;-SMA (Grunert et al 2003; Zeisberg and Neilson 2009).&nbsp;

	mmo:0000000	"""Immunohistochemistry (routinely used and recommended)

Proliferation of fibroblasts and activation of myofibroblasts is normally detected using individual antibodies against vimentin, procollagen 1 and alpha-smooth muscle actin, specific markers of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (Zhang 1994). It is recommended to use more than one marker to confirm the activation of fibroblasts. The species-specific antibodies for all the markers are commercially available and the technique works in both in vitro and in vivo models as well as in human specimens. Immunohistochemistry is performed using immunoperoxidase technique. Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded lung sections are sliced in 3-5&micro;m thin slices and reacted with diluted H2O2 for 10 min to block the endogenous peroxidase activity. The slices are then incubated with appropriate dilutions of primary antibody against the individual markers followed by incubation with the secondary antibody that is biotinylated. The slices are incubated for additional 30 minutes for avidin-biotin amplification and reacted with substrate 3&rsquo;3&rsquo; diaminobenzidine before visualising the cells under the light microscope. Although only semi-quantitative, morphometric analysis of the lung slices can be conducted to quantify the total number of cells expressing the markers against the control lung sections where expression of specific markers is expected to be low or nil. For the morphometric analysis, using ocular grids, images of 20-25 non-overlapping squares (0.25 mm2) from 2-3 random lung section are taken under 20x magnification. Minimum of three animals per treatment group are assessed. Some researchers include only those cells that are positive for both procollagen I and alpha smooth muscle markers.

The limitation of the technique is that the antibodies have to be of high quality and specific. Background noise due to non-specific reactions can yield false-positive results.

In vitro, expression of type-1 collagen, Thy-1, cyclooxygenase-2 and vaeolin-1 are used as markers of homogeneous population of fibroblasts. Increased expression of TGF-b and a-smooth muscle actin is used as markers of differentiated myofibroblasts. Transcription factor Smad3 is the other marker measured in vitro to assess the fibroblast proliferation and differentiation. Several in vitro studies using lung epithelial cells (e.g. A549 cells) have shown that asbestos induces markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Tamminen et al 2012), which is mediated by the activation of TGF-&beta;-p-Smad2 (Kim et al 2006).

Hydrogels

Hydrogels are water-swollen crosslinked polymer networks. They are used to mimic the original extracellular matrix (ECM). Hydrogels consist of collagen, fibrin, hyaluronic acid or synthetic materials such as polyacrylamide enriched with ECM proteins, etc. Hydrogels can be prepared to express inherent biological signals, mechanical properties (e.g., modulus) and biochemical properties (e.g., proteins) of the ECM. Fibroblasts are usually cultured in fibrin and type-1 collagen that represent the matrix of the wound healing. Thus, the well-constructed hydrogel can be used to assess cell proliferation, activation and matrix synthesis as reflective of fibroblast activation. For naturally derived hydrogen scaffolds, cells derived directly from animal or human tissues can be used (Megan 2014).

Fibroblast proliferation assay

Several primary and immortalised fibroblast types can be used for the assay.

	dcterms:description	"""ECM is a macromolecular structure that provides physical support to tissues and is essential for organ function. The composition of ECM is tissue specific and consists mainly of fibrous proteins, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. The ECM in lung is compartmentalised to basement membrane and the interstitial space. Fibroblasts found in the interstitial space are the main sources of ECM in lung. Altered composition of ECM is observed in several lung diseases of inflammatory origin in humans including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, asthma and idiopathic lung fibrosis (reviewed in White 2015).&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is suggested that ECM composition dramatically changes during the fibrotic process. The early fibrotic process is characterised by collagen III deposition and collagen 1 predominates the later stages of the fibrosis. The fibrotic ECM contains characteristic accumulation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, which are the major contributors of ECM synthesised. The proliferation of fibroblasts and their differentiation into myofibroblasts is, in turn, guided by the composition and structure of the ECM. For example, the composition and architecture of the ECM determines 1) the open sites of attachment that are available to cells, 2) the mechanical properties of the ECM and 3) the mechanical loading (breathing) experienced by the cells. Thus, changes in the ECM composition during the exaggerated wound healing process determines if an organism commits to fibrotic process or completes the wound healing (Blaauboer ME, 2014). Studies have demonstrated that cytokines secreted in response to inflammation are capable of activating fibroblasts, and that these changes could cause alterations in the fibroblasts that lead to excessive proliferation and ECM deposition (Sivakumar, P., 2012; Wynn, T.A., 2011). 

In lung fibrosis, an exaggerated amount of ECM is distributed in the alveolar parenchyma in a non-heterogenous manner, occluding alveolar regions leading to reduced gas exchange. Collagen 1 and Collagen III are suggested to be the main components of the ECM in the thickened alveolar septa in fibrosis with other constituents such as fibronectin, elastin and tenacin C (Zhang, K., 1994; Hinz, B., 2006; Kuhn, C., 1991; Crabb, R.A., 2006; Bensadoun, E.S., 1996; Klingberg, F., 2013; McKleroy, W., 2013). Excessive collagen production by myofibroblasts forms the basis of scar formation containing almost exclusively Type I collagen (Bateman, ED, 1981; McKleroy, W., 2013; Zhang, K., 1994). Several types of collagen exist, with differences based on their tissue localisation and function. However, type I collagen is the most abundant throughout the body, as well as in lung scar tissue. Studies have demonstrated that while total collagen increases in IPF, there is also a shift toward the less elastic type I collagen, which contributes to the stiffness of the scar tissue within the lung (Nimni, M.E.1983; Rozin, G.F., 2005; McKleroy, W., 2013).
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""The qRT-PCR, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry are routinely used to assess the levels of protein and mRNA levels. The various genes and proteins that are assessed include, collagen I, collagen III, elastin and tenacin C. Histological staining with stains such as Masson Trichrome, Picro-sirius red are used to identify the tissue/cellular distribution of collagen, which can be quantified using morphometric analysis both in vivo and in vitro. The assays are routinely used and are quantitative.

SircolTM Collagen Assay for collagen quantification

The Serius dye has been used for many decades to detect collagen in histology samples. The Serius Red F3BA selectively binds to collagen and the signal can be read at 540 nm (Clarice ZC, 2009).

Hydroxyproline assay

Hydroxyproline is a non-proteinogenic amino acid formed by the prolyl-4-hydroxylase. Hydroxyproline is only found in collagen and thus, it serves as a direct measure of the amount of collagen present in cells or tissues. Colorimetric methods are readily available and have been extensively used to quantify collagen using this assay (Clarice ZC, 2009).

Fibrosis or scarring is a fixed end result of damage in a tissue not capable of regeneration with no possibility of restoring the original tissue architecture. In normal lung, an individual alveolus spans about 0.2mm in diameter and there are 300 million alveoli in an adult male lung. In between the two adjacent alveoli are two layers of alveolar epithelium resting on basement membrane, which consists of interstitial space, pulmonary capillaries, elastin and collagen fibres. Thus, the alveolar capillary membrane, where gas exchange takes place, is made up of the alveolar epithelium and alveolar endothelium (Gracey DR, 1968). In fibrotic disease however, a pronounced decrease in the number of capillaries within the alveolar septa is found with asymmetric deposition of collagen and cells between part of the surface of a capillary and the nearby alveolar lining. In areas where capillaries are not present, the alveolar capillary membrane is occupied with collagen and cells.

""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""How it is measured

Histopathological analysis is used for assessing fibrotic lung disease. Morphometric analysis of the diseased area versus total lung area is used to quantitatively stage the fibrotic disease. Although, some inconsistencies can be introduced during the analysis due to the experience of the individual scoring the disease, the histological stain, etc., a numerical scale with grades from 0 to 8, originally developed by Ashcroft et al (1988) is assigned to indicate the amount of fibrotic tissue in histological samples. This scale is applied to diagnose lung fibrosis in both human and animal samples. Modifications to this scoring system were proposed (Hubner R-H, 2008), which enables morphological distinctions thus enabling a better grading of the disease. Using the modified scoring system, bleomycin induced lung fibrosis in rats was scored as follows: Grade 0 &ndash; normal lung, Grade 1 &ndash; isolated alveolar septa with gentle fibrotic changes, Grade 2 &ndash; knot like formation in fibrotic areas in alveolar septa, Grade 3 &ndash; contiguous fibrotic walls of alveolar septa, Grade 4 &ndash; single fibrotic masses, Grade 5 &ndash; confluent fibrotic masses, Grade 6 &ndash; large contiguous fibrotic masses, Grade 7 &ndash; air bubbles and Grade 8 &ndash; fibrotic obliteration. Further morphometric analysis can be conducted to quantify the total disease area as shown in (Nikota et al., 2017).

Lungs are formalin fixed and paraffin embedded such that an entire cross section of lung can be presented on a slide. The entire cross section is captured in a series of images using wide field light microscope. Areas of alveolar epithelium thickening and consolidated air space are identified. ImageJ software (freely available) is used to trace the total area (green line) and the diseased area (red line) imaged and quantified. The diseased area is equal to disease area/total area (Nikota J, 2017).&nbsp;

In vitro, there is no single assay that can measure the alveolar thickness. However, a&nbsp;combination of assays spanning various KEs described above provide a measure of the extent of fibrogenesis potential of tested substances. qRT-PCR and ELISA assays measuring increased collagen, TGF&beta;1 and various pro-inflammatory mediators are used as sensitive markers of potential of substances to induce the adverse outcome of lung fibrosis.

	dcterms:description	"""Thyroxine (T4) uptake from serum into tissues plays a substantial role in thyroid hormone action, as it can then be available for enzymatic conversion to the active hormone, triiodothyronine (T3).  Uptake of T4 into cells/tissues is mediated by active transport proteins that exhibit unique expression profiles depending on tissue type and timing of development (Hennemann et al., 2001; Visser et al., 2011, 2007; Connors et al., 2010; Friesema et al., 2005). Specific regulation of transporter profiles plays a role in timing of thyroid hormone uptake into specific tissues for proper sequencing of development and protection against metabolism and clearance of thyroid hormone during critical developmental periods.  Although several different classes of proteins have been identified as capable of transporting T4 (and T3) across plasma membranes, three proteins in particular have been shown to have high affinity and specificity toward thyroid hormone; namely, MCT8, MCT10 and OATP1c1 (Friesema et al., 2003, 2008; Pizzagalli et al., 2002; Jansen et al., 2007; Mayer et al., 2014).  These transport proteins have primarily been studied in relation to mammalian brain development, so the details of their role in other species and tissues during vertebrate development are not well-understood.
Decreases in tissue T4 could potentially occur in several ways individually or in combination, (1) circulating levels of T4 decrease to critical levels that even compensatory increases in active transport cannot overcome, (2) TH-specific transporters are non-functional either due to mutation, inhibited by a xenobiotic or their transcriptional expression is repressed, (3) enhanced T4 catabolism by type III deiodinase in peripheral tissues or by phase II metabolic enzymes in the liver.

Tissues typically contain low levels of thyroid hormones and are generally complex sample matrices, making analyses of thyroid hormones in tissues challenging.  This requires special consideration for the composition of the specific tissue in order to employ the proper sample preparation technique.  Ideally, analyses of tissue TH is a two-step process starting with extraction and then subsequent analyses.  Extraction procedures for thyroid hormones, their precursors and analogues have been demonstrated in whole body homogenates of fish or tadpoles using ethanol extractions, tadpole and rat thyroid gland tissue using proteolytic digestions and rat peripheral tissues using methanol-chloroform extractions (see reference table: [1] for details).  Analyses of sample extracts have been performed using radioimmunoassay (RIA), liquid-chromatography inductively coupled mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP/MS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/HPLC-MS/MS).  These methods generally require addition of radioisotope labeled compounds (RIA) or stable isotope labeled compounds (LC-MS/MS) to samples prior to the extraction procedure in order to correct for recovery, so the extraction and analysis steps are not entirely independent of each other.  Another consideration for the technique employed to measure thyroid hormones is that RIA methods are only capable of measuring a single analyte at a time and is typically either T3 or T4 whereas LC-ICP/MS and LC-MS/MS methods allow quantitation of thyroid hormones, precursors and metabolites all in the same sample (see reference table: [2] for details).

	dcterms:alternative	"Altered, Amphibian metamorphosis" ;

	dcterms:description	"""Vertebrate metamorphosis is a biological transformation process that transitions an organism from one life stage to another; it is defined by growth of new tissues, programmed death of other tissues and physiological transformation of yet other tissues (Laudet, 2011; Brown and Cai, 2007).  In the case of most amphibians, metamorphosis mediates the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life, while in bony and jawless fish, metamorphosis mediates transitions between life stages that offer various advantages for survival and reproduction.  In vertebrates, metamorphosis is orchestrated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis involving complex timing of gene expression/repression within various tissues, whereas in some cases across taxonomic classes, metamorphosis has been shown to be controlled very differently by the HPT axis.  
Thyroid hormone-mediated amphibian metamorphosis can be characterized by three phases during larval development: (1) pre-metamorphosis, (2) pro-metamorphosis and (3) metamorphic climax.  All three of these phases coincide with activity states of the HPT axis.  Pre-metamorphosis is characterized by a fully aquatic organism with low-level function of the thyroid gland and very low circulating levels of thyroid hormone.  Pro-metamorphosis is characterized by the onset of full thyroid axis function and the initiation of rising levels of thyroid hormone in the plasma, with consequential changes in anatomy and physiology defining the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life.  Metamorphic climax occurs when circulating thyroid hormone levels peak, which subsequently decrease to levels maintained homeostatically as adults.  This climax period also represents the time at which all anatomical and physiological changes induced by thyroid hormone have either been initiated or are already completed.  Detailed descriptions of these processes are reviewed by Brown and Cai (2007).
Altered metamorphosis occurs when these thyroid hormone-mediated processes are perturbed, primarily during pro-metamorphosis and metamorphic climax.  These perturbations can lead to either, delayed/arrested development, accelerated development or asynchronous development depending on the xenobiotic mode of action or MIE.  Genetic defects or xenobiotic exposure that reduce thyroid hormone synthesis can delay metamorphosis, and in extreme cases, can completely arrest development.  The most profound impacts on TH-mediated metamorphosis have be demonstrated through inhibition of key proteins in the TH synthesis pathway including the sodium-iodide symporter (Tietge et al., 2005, 2010; Hornung et al., 2010) and thyroperoxidase (Degitz et al., 2005; Tietge et al., 2010, 2013; Hornung et al., 2010, 2015).  Alternatively, agonism of the thyroid axis through inhibition of negative feedback at the level of the hypothalamus-pituitary, or premature activation of thyroid receptor-mediated transcription can accelerate metamorphosis (Degitz et al., 2005), which can lead to asynchronous development due to errors in gene expression timing across the various metamorphic tissues.  Asynchronous development can also occur due to inhibition of deiodinase (DIO) enzymes in peripheral tissues. DIO enzymes are responsible for activation and catabolism of TH; when dio gene expression profiles are altered, or the enzymes themselves undergo chemical inhibition, the imbalance of prohormone (T4), active hormone (T3) and inactive hormone (rT3, T2) can cause aberrant tissue development.

Serotonergic neurotransmission results in increased levels of cAMP which, in turn, activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates Serine and threonine residues, which directly increases or decreases the activities of numerous proteins. PKA also activates CREB which binds the cAMP response element, altering downstream gene transcription. In the bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis, two isoforms of PKA have been identified with regulatory subunits R(myt1) and R(myt 2). The isoform with R(myt2)appears to mediate cAMP control over cilia beat frequency(Bardales et al., 2011).

	dcterms:description	"""Type II topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that are required for proper chromosome structure and segregation and play important roles in DNA replication, transcription, and recombination. Type II topoisomerases change&nbsp;DNA&nbsp;topology by breaking and rejoining double-stranded DNA. These enzymes can introduce or remove supercoils and can separate two DNA duplexes that are intertwined.&nbsp;Type II topoisomerases relax DNA and remove knots and tangles from the genetic material by passing an intact double helix (transport segment) through a transient double-stranded break that they generate in a separate DNA segment (gate segment). Humans encode two closely related isoforms of the type II enzyme.&nbsp;Topoisomerase II &THORN;&nbsp;is essential for the survival of proliferating cells and topoisomerase II &szlig;&nbsp;plays critical roles during development. However, because these enzymes generate double-stranded DNA breaks during their crucial catalytic functions, the consequences are not only beneficial. Although essential to cell survival, they also pose an intrinsic threat to genomic integrity every time they act. Beyond their critical physiological functions, topoisomerase II&THORN;&nbsp;and II&szlig;&nbsp;are the primary targets for some of the most active and widely prescribed drugs currently used for the treatment of human cancers. These agents kill cells by increasing levels of covalent topoisomerase II-cleaved DNA complexes that are normal, but fleeting, intermediates in the catalytic DNA strand passage reaction. Many chemicals&nbsp;do so by inhibiting the ability of the type II enzymes to ligate cleaved DNAs. When the resulting enzyme-associated DNA breaks are present in sufficient concentrations, they can trigger cell death pathways. Chemicals&nbsp;that target type II enzymes are referred to as topoisomerase II poisons because they convert these indispensable enzymes to potent physiological toxins that generate DNA damage in treated cells.&nbsp;Because the enzyme functions by passing an intact double helix through a transient double-stranded break, any disturbances in its function, e.g. by chemical inhibitors, could have a profound effect on genomic stability, resulting in DNA repair response, gene and chromosomal damage, initiation of apoptosis and ultimate cell death. A double-strand break and error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair mechanism may lead to gene rearrangements; chromosomal translocations and consequently fusion genes (see Figure 33). A comprehensive description of TopoII enzymes and their functions and derangements could be found in recent review articles (Cowell and Austin 2012; Pendleton et al 2014; Ketron and Osheroff 2014).



Fig.33: TOP2 Poisons, downstream events. TOP2 poisons inhibit the religation step of the TOP2 reaction cycle, leading to accumulation of covalent TOP2-DNA cleavage complexes. These lesions are cytotoxic and lead to activation of the DNA damage response and potentially apoptosis. Alternatively these lesions are repaired, largely through the non-homologous end-joining pathway. Translocations observed in therapy-related leukemia are presumed to occur as a result of mis-repair, joining two heterologous ends. (from Cowell and Austin 2012)

DNA topoisomerase (Top) II enzyme &ldquo;poisons&rdquo; disturb the normal TopoII enzyme function and cause a &lsquo;hanging double strand break (DSB)&rsquo; at a specified DNA sequence. The above description of the MIE is of significance because there are 3 different kinds of &ldquo;poisons&quot; of TopoII enzyme, out of which competitive inhibitors prevent the function of the enzyme and cause cell death, whereas other interfacial and covalent inhibitors may cause &ndash; depending on the situation &ndash; other consequences of DNA damage response including chromosomal rearrangements (Pendleton et L 2014; Lu et al 2015). A further prerequisite for the specific outcome, i.e. creation of chromosomal rearrangement, is that TopoII &ldquo;poison&rdquo; has to occur in an especially vulnerable and correct hot spot in the MLL locus in the right target cell vulnerable to transformation.

In the context of this AOP, and in line with the title of this AOP, it is important to note that the MIE, topo II poisons, has to occur prenatally i.e. prenatal exposure to topo II poisons.&nbsp;Human embryonic stem cells are more sensitive to topo II inhibition than postnatal CD34+ cells, linking embryonic exposure to topoisomerase II poisons to genomic instability. However, little is know about the nature of the target cell for transformation (Bueno et al. 2011).

	mmo:0000000	"""The identification and measurement of the inhibition of TopoII enzymes is made more difficult by the presence of different molecular mechanisms (see above). However, some assays are used in pharmacological research to screen TopoII &ldquo;poisons&rdquo;, including cell-free decatenation assay (Schroeter et al., 2015). The most important mode, the cleavage activity of TopoII can be studied in vitro, by using a human recombinant enzyme and an appropriate double-stranded plasmid as a target to quantitate double-strand breaks (Fortune and Osheroff 1998). A cleavage can also be indirectly detected by measuring various indicators of DNA damage response, such as ATM activity, p53 expression, &gamma;H2AX or Comet assay (Li et al 2014, Schroeter et al., 2015, Castano et al 2016).

It is useful to note that several chemicals identified as TopoII &ldquo;poisons&rdquo;do require metabolic oxidation to become active inhibitors. Etoposide itself is converted via the catechol metabolite to etoposide 3-quinone, which is a covalent TopoII poison (Smith et al 2014), whereas etoposide and its catechol are interfacial inhibitors. Curcumin is also an active TopoII poison due to its oxidized metabolites (Gordon et al 2015). This fact deserves consideration if a screening for TopoII inhibition is envisaged.

Topoisomerase poisons stabilize the covalent enzyme&ndash;DNA complex. There are several key characteristics of this complex: it includes protein covalently bound to DNA as well as a strand break in the DNA substrate, and it is also freely reversible. Accordingly, if the chemical&nbsp;is removed the enzyme rapidly reseals the DNA. Covalent complexes are quantified in two ways: by measuring the levels of protein covalently bound to DNA or by directly assaying for DNA strand breaks in the presence of topoisomerase and test agent or known drug. The assay directly measures DNA strand breaks induced by topoisomerase I in a substrate that carries a strong DNA cleavage site. Similarly, the plasmid linearization assay measures double strand breaks induced in plasmid DNA by topoisomerase II. The Alternate Protocol allows for the visualization of breaks induced on a larger substrate. Different protocols&nbsp;are used to measure the amount of the cleavage complex by determining the levels of topoisomerases that are covalently associated with DNA. Since the covalent complex is a normal step in the topoisomerase reaction, it can be detected (using very sensitive assays) even in the absence of a topoisomerase poison. However, addition of a topoisomerase poison greatly increases the levels of covalent comple. Protocol and procedure details for mewasuring topoisomerase inhibition are fully reported in Nitiss et al. 2012.

	dcterms:description	"""Chromosomal rearrangements of the mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene, located on the q23 band of chromosome 11 (11q23), are the genetic hallmark of most infant leukaemias (Meyer et al 2013; Sanjuan-Pla et al 2015). MLL is located within the fragile site FRA11G; chromosomal fragile sites are regions of the genome susceptible to breakage under conditions of replication stress; interference with TopoII may promote fragile site instability. MLL encodes a protein homologous to the Drosophila trithorax gene, which has relevant functions in embryogenesis and hematopoiesis (Ernest et al 2004, Hess et al 1997).

MLL, a human homologue of the epigenetic transcriptional regulator Trithorax of&nbsp;Drosophila,&nbsp;is an upstream transcriptional effector of&nbsp;HOX&nbsp;genes.&nbsp;The importance of normal MLL protein for normal axial-skeletal developmental process and&nbsp;HOX&nbsp;gene regulation has been demonstrated in the embryos of heterozygous and homozygous&nbsp;MLL&nbsp;knockout&nbsp;and&nbsp;MLL&nbsp;truncation mutant mice.&nbsp;Furthermore, expression of MLL protein is not necessary for turning on transcription of certain&nbsp;HOX&nbsp;genes, but for the maintenance of their transcription. Experiments&nbsp;in vitro&nbsp;using hematopoietic progenitors from embryos of homozygous&nbsp;MLL&nbsp;knockout mice&nbsp;or mice with&nbsp;MLL&nbsp;mutant showed that MLL was also critical for hematopoietic development. Recent findings suggested that MLL is required during embryogenesis for the specification or expansion of hematopoietic stem cells. &nbsp;As&nbsp;HOX&nbsp;genes also play a key role in the regulation of hematopoietic development,&nbsp;the hematopoietic dysfunction of&nbsp;MLL&nbsp;null cells is likely to be attributed to deregulated patterns of&nbsp;HOX&nbsp;gene expression in hematopoietic stem cells or progenitors. This link between MLL,&nbsp;HOX&nbsp;gene regulation, and hematopoiesis is of particular importance (Li et al. 2005).

There are many translocation and fusion partners for MLL; DNA breakage within MLL can lead to rearrangement with over 120 partner genes (Meyer et al 2013). In principle all MLL fusion genes are potential initiating drivers, although clinical studies have shown a preponderance with infant leukaemia for only a few of these rearrangements. For infants diagnosed with ALL, approximately 60-80% carry an MLL rearrangement (Sam et al 2012; Jansen et al 2007), with predominant fusion partners being AF4 (41%), ENL (18%), AF9 (11%) or another partner gene (10%). In particular, the fusion gene MLL-AF4 shows a specific and consistent relationship with the disease (Menendez et al., 2009): however, it has been difficult to reproduce a manifest disease resulting from this rearrangement in&nbsp;in vivo&nbsp;animal models. For AML, about 30 % of the patients carry an MLL rearrangement.

The occurrence of MLL rearrangements at a very early fetal development is highly probable on the basis of neonatal blood spot analysis and by the high concordance rate of infant leukaemia in monozygotic twins (Ford et al 1993; Gale et al 1997; Sanjuan-Pla 2015). Menendez et al (2009) showed that MLL-AF4 fusion gene is present in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in infant leukaemia patients, but not in patients of childhood leukaemia, suggesting that the origin of the fusion gene is probably prehaematopoietic. Consequently, the affected cell, the so called leukaemia-initiating cell, may be an early prehaematopoietic mesodermal precursor, a hematopoietic stem cell or hematopoietic progenitor cell residing mainly in the liver (Greaves 2015; Sanjuan-Pla et al 2015).

MLL protein (complexed with a large number of other protein factors) serves as a transcriptional activator or repressor via the binding to promoter regions of active genes, marking these regions by covalent histone modifications (Sanjuan-Pla et al 2015). Translocation and creation of fusion genes and products destroys the intrinsic control mechanisms of the MLL protein. The resulting &lsquo;ectopic&rsquo; functions involve promoter hyper-activation and re-acquiring stem cell features (Sanjuan-Pla et al 2015). A schematic presentation of the drastic changes of the MLL product is depicted in the figure below.

&nbsp;



Proposed model for the oncogenic conversion of MLL fusion: A. Physiological situation and B: . A chromosomal translocation, which leads to the intrinsic regulatory mechanism of MLL being destroyed. (Sanjuan-Pla et al. 2015).

&nbsp;

MLL translocation sites (breakpoint sequences) in the therapy-related leukaemia fall within a few base pairs of etoposide-induced enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage site (r). Although rearrangements associated with infant leukaemias are often more complex than those observed in treatment-related leukaemias, many are nevertheless associated with stable TopoII-mediated DNA cut sites. Although all these findings are indirect regarding infant leukaemia, they are nevertheless rather persuasive in this respect.

Growing scientific evidence, including the stable genome of the patients, suggests that infant leukaemia originates from one &ldquo;big-hit&rdquo; occurring during a critical developmental window of stem cell vulnerability (Andersson et al 2013; Greaves 2015). Therefore, the totality of evidence suggests the&nbsp;essential&nbsp;role of the formation of MLL-AF4 (and other partner) fusion gene and product in causing pleiotropic effects in the affected cell and directing it to the obligatory pathway to the adverse outcome of leukaemia (see KER2).&nbsp;

	Split-signal FISH: The split-signal FISH approach uses two differentially labeled probes, located in one gene at opposite sites of the breakpoint region. Probe sets were developed for the genes&nbsp;TCF3 (E2A)&nbsp;at 19p13,&nbsp;MLL&nbsp;at 11q23,&nbsp;ETV6&nbsp;at 12p13,&nbsp;BCR&nbsp;at 22q11,&nbsp;SIL-TAL1&nbsp;at 1q32 and&nbsp;TLX3 (HOX11L2)&nbsp;at 5q35. In normal karyotypes, two colocalized green/red signals are visible, but a translocation results in a split of one of the colocalized signals. Split-signal FISH has three main advantages over the classical fusion-signal FISH approach, which uses two labeled probes located in two genes. First, the detection of a chromosome aberration is independent of the involved partner gene. Second, split-signal FISH allows the identification of the partner gene or chromosome region if metaphase spreads are present, and finally it reduces false-positivity (Van der Burg et al, 2004).
	RT-PCR in combination with long-distance inverse PCR (LDI-PCR) performed on isolated genomic DNA. This method allows the identification of any kind of&nbsp;MLL&nbsp;rearrangement if located within the breakpoint cluster region.&nbsp;&nbsp;The method&nbsp;uses long-distance inverse PCR (LDI-PCR) to identify&nbsp;MLL&nbsp;translocations independent of the involved partner gene or other&nbsp;MLL&nbsp;aberrations that occurred within the&nbsp;MLL&nbsp;breakpoint cluster region. This method allows high-throughput analyses because genomic&nbsp;MLL&nbsp;fusion sequences can be obtained with a minimum of only four PCR reactions. Moreover, this method requires only small quantities of genomic patient DNA (1 &mu;g) and provides relevant genetic information that can be used directly for quantitative minimal residual disease (MRD) analyses (Meyer et al. 2005).


Assays measuring chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei or DNA and chromosome damage (Comet assay) may indirectly identify the KE through its consequences in experimental systems in vitro and in vivo. FISH staining is however necessary for identification of MLL translocations.

	dcterms:description	"""B cell ALL&nbsp;is the most frequent cancer in children. Infant leukaemia is a rare haematological disease with an incidence of 1 in 106 newborns, accounting for 10% of all B cell-ALLs in children younger than 15 years, manifesting soon after birth (&lt;1 year) and displaying an intermediate prognosis except for some cytogenetic subgroups such as MLL -rearranged&nbsp;(MLL-r) B cell-ALL, which remains an outlier high-risk group having a poor prognosis (Sanjuan-Pla et al., 2015). Compared with the more frequent childhood leukaemias, infant leukaemia shows distinct features (see Table 1 for a more comprehensive comparison):

- An early neonatal manifestation suggests an in utero initiation as an &lsquo;intrauterine developmental disease&rsquo; (Greaves, 2015; Sanjuan-Pla et al., 2015);

- Rearrangements of the MLL&nbsp;gene on the q23 band of chromosome 11 as the hallmark genetic abnormality (Joannides and Grimwade, 2010).

- However, MLL is not the only translocation gene.&nbsp;Whereas about 60&ndash;80% of infant ALL carry an MLL(Sam et al., 2012; Jansen et al., 2007), for infant acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) the percentage of MLL&nbsp;is lower than 40%;

- The MLL-r&nbsp;occurs at an early stage of development, with the target cells (still unidentified) being likely theHSPCs&nbsp;in foetal liver and/or pre-haematopoietic mesodermal foetal precursors (Bueno et al., 2009; Menendez et al., 2009);

- Infant MLL-r leukaemia has the least number of somatic mutations among all the sequenced cancers (1.3 vs 6.5/case; Andersson et al., 2015; Dobbins et al., 2013), pointing to the lack of a &ldquo;second hit&rdquo; assumed in the classic carcinogenesis paradigm.

&nbsp;

The overall scientific evidence, including the stable genome of patients, suggests that infant leukaemia originates from one &ldquo;big-hit&rdquo; occurring during a critical developmental window of HSPC vulnerability (Andersson et al., 2013; Greaves, 2015). In contrast to the &ldquo;two-hit&rdquo; model of the adult and childhood leukaemias, infant leukaemia is a developmental disorder where the differentiation arrest and clonal expansion are a direct consequence of in utero MLL translocation in target HSPCs. Even if MLL is not present in 100% of infant leukaemias, the &lsquo;MLL rearranged (MLL-r) infant leukaemia&rsquo;, especially MLL-r B-ALL, is taken here as a model for the disease principally because of the quantity of scientific evidence.

Clinically,IFL is characterised by symptoms of leukaemia &ndash; thrombocytopenia resulting in sensitivity to bruising and bleeding, anaemia with pallor and fatigue, neutropenia associated with increased susceptibility to infections &ndash; are principally due to the displacement of the normal haematopoiesis by expansion of leukaemia cells. Leukemic infiltration of the brain is common at diagnosis of the infant leukaemia (Hunger and Mulligham, 2015).

Following clinical diagnosis, methods for refined diagnosis include bone marrow aspirates for immunophenotypic analyses and cytogenetic assays for molecular stratification.

The carcinogenicity assays and the extended one generation test (OECD 443) include endpoints that can potentially explore the AO; however, considerations should be made on the specificity of the disease to humans. Indeed, IFL, as such, is not an animal disease and never reported as chemically induced outcome in cancerogenesis studies. it should however be noted that cancerogenesis studis are generally performed in young adult animals and protocol including the treatment of the dams &nbsp;from the mating period are not common. for this reason, the sensitivity of the cancerogenesis study to capture this hazard is at its best unknown.

	dcterms:description	"""DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) is formed as a consequence of the production of excision repair breaks opposite each other on the two strands of DNA, and by the production of an excision repair break opposite a DNA daughter-strand gap. DSB are considered to be critical primary lesions in the formation of chromosomal aberrations.

To repare this potentially lethal damage, eukaryotic cells have evolved a variety of repair pathways related to homologous and illegitimate recombination, also called non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ), which may induce small scale mutations and chromosomal aberration (Pfeiffer et al. 2000). Repair by NHEJ often leads to small deletions at the site of the DSB and is considered error prone. The second repair mechanism, the Homologous Recombination (HR) is directed by extensive homology in a partner DNA molecule. In mitotic cells NHEJ occurs throughout all phases of the cell cycle, whereas HR is largely restricted to the S and G2 phases when the sister chromatid is available to mediate the repair process (Reynard et al. 2017).&nbsp;Persistent or incorrectly repaired DSBs can result in chromosome loss, deletion, translocation, or fusion, which can lead to carcinogenesis through activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (Raynard et al.2017). The DSB repair pathways apper to compete for DSBs, but the balance between them differs widely among species, between different cell types of a single species, and during different cell cycle phases of a single cell type. (Shrivastav et al. 2008).

DSBs are induced by agents such as ionizing radiation and chemicals that directly or indirectly damage DNA ans are commonly used in cancer therapy (Shrivastav et al. 2008). DSBs&nbsp;also arise during DNA replication when the DNA-polymerase ensemble encounters obstacles such as DNA lesions or unusual DNA structures (Raynard et al 2017). Additional endogenous sources include reactive oxygen species, generated during cellular metabolism, collapsed replication forks and nucleases(Shrivastav et al. 2008) .
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""&nbsp;A very early step in the cellular response to DSBs is the phosphorylation of a histone H2A variant, H2AX, at the sites of DNA damage. H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated (within seconds) at serine 139 when DSBs are introduced into mammalian cells resulting in discrete &gamma;-H2AX (phosphorylated H2AX) foci at the DNA damage sites. H2AX phosphorylation also appearsto be a general cellular response to processes involving DSB intermediates including V(D)J recombination in lymphoid cells and meiotic recombination in mice. Phosphorylation of H2A atserine 139 causes chromatin decondensation and appears to play a critical role in the recruitment of repair or damage-signaling factors to the sites of DNA damage. &nbsp;DNA DSB staining &nbsp;based on the phosphorylation of the histone H2A.X at serine 139 in response to DNA damaging agents which cause double strand breaks in cells that are cultured in microtiter plates is a rapid metod for the identification and quantification of the damage (Sealunavov et al.2002).

Microscopic examination of individual mammalian cells embedded in agarose, subjected to electrophoresis, and stained with a DNA-binding dye provides a way of measuring DNA damage and of assessing heterogeinicity in DNA damage within a mixed cell population. (Olive P. et al. 1991).

Pulsed field&nbsp;gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is the main method used for measurement of DNA DSB in mammalian cells (Blocker D et al. 1989 and 1990, Stamato T et al 1990, Ager D et al 1990). Alternatively the DNA is size fractioned in the pulsed-field gel, and the weight fraction of DNA below a certain defined size is measured (Erixo K. et al. 1990, Stenelow B. et al. 1995). An additional method to measure prompt DSBs without including heat-labile sites is also reported (Stenerlow B. et al. 2003).

In vitro assays for topoisomerase II based on the decantation of double strand DNA are extensively reported in Nitiss et al. 2012.

	dcterms:description	"""Apoptosis is the programmed cell death in general. Apoptosis, also called as &ldquo;physiological cell death&rdquo;, is involved in cell turnover, physiological involution and atrophy of various tissues and organs (Kerr, 1972). The formation of apoptotic bodies involves marked condensation of both nucleus and cytoplasm, nuclear fragmentation, and separation of protuberances (Kerr, 1972).

Apoptosis is characterized by DNA ladder and chromatin condensation. Several stimuli such as hypoxia, nucleotides deprivation, chemotherapeutical drugs, DNA damage, and mitotic spindle damage induce p53 activation, leading to p21 activation and cell cycle arrest [Pucci, 2000]. The SAHA or TSA treatment on neonatal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) for 24 or 72 hrs inhibited proliferation of the NHDF cells [Glaser, 2003]. Considering that the acetylation of histone H4 was increased by the treatment of SAHA for 4 hrs, histone deacetylase inhibition may be involved in the inhibition of the cell proliferation [Glaser, 2003]. The impaired proliferation was observed in HDAC1-/- ES cells, which was rescued with the reintroduction of HDAC1 [Zupkovitz, 2010]. The present AOP focuses on p21 pathway leading to apoptosis, however, the alternative pathway such as NF-kB signaling pathways may be involved in apoptosis of spermatocytes [Wang, 2017].

The apoptosis is measured with down-regulation of anti-apoptotic gene baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat containing 2 (BIRC2, or cIAP1) [Parajuli, 2014]. Apoptotic nucleosomes were detected using Cell Death Detection ELISA kit, which were calculated as absorbance subtraction at 405 nm and 490 [Parajuli, 2014]. Cell viability was measured with live cell number changes using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay [Parajuli, 2014]. Cleavage of PARP was detected with Western blotting [Parajuli, 2014]. The proliferation/viability of NHDFs was measured with Alamar-Blue [modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] [Glaser, 2003]. Proliferation of the HDAC-/- ES cells was determined with crystal violet and measurement of absorbance at 595 nm [Zupkovitz, 2010]. Caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity is measured with the enzyme-catalyzed release of p-nitroanilide (pNA) and quantified at 405 nm (Wu, 2016). Apoptosis is measured with Annexin V-FITC probes, and the relative percentage of Annexin V-FITC-positive/PI-negative cells is analyzed by flow cytometry (Wu, 2016).

The nucleosome consists of core histones having classes of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) [Damaskos, 2017]. DNA strand (about 200 bp) wound around the core histones, where histone deacetylase (HDAC) effects on the lysine residue of the histone to hydrolyze the acetyl residue [Damaskos, 2017]. Histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) inhibits HDAC and acetylate the histones and release the DNA strand to induce the binding of transcription factors [Taunton, 1996]. HDIs have potentials as anti-cancer pharmaceuticals since HDIs induce the transcriptional restoration of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes by regulating acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins [Lee, 2016] [Minucci, 2006].

It is known that 18 HDAC isoforms are classified into four classes: class I HDACs (isoforms 1, 2, 3, 8), class II isoforms (4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10) and class III HDACs (the sirtuins) and HDAC11 [Weichert, 2009, Barneda-Zahonero, 2012]. HDACs 1, 2 and 3 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas HDAC8 is predominantly expressed in cells with smooth muscle/myoepithelial differentiation [Weichert, 2009]. HDAC6 is not observed to express in lymphocytes, stromal cells and vascular endothelial cells [Weichert, 2009]. Class III HDACs sirtuins are widely expressed and localized in different cellular compartments [Barneda-Zahonero, 2012]. SirT1 is highly expressed in testis, thymus and multiple types of germ cells [Bell, 2014]. HDAC11 expression is enriched in kidney, brain, testis, heart and skeletal muscle [Barneda-Zahonero, 2012].

Epigenetic modifications including the histone acetylation are measured using chromatin immunoprecipitation-microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip) [ENCODE Project Consortium, 2004, Ren, 2004]. ChIP detects physical interaction between transcription factors or cofactors and the chromosome [Johnson, 2007].

MAA produces testicular and thymic atrophy [Miller, 1982, Moss, 1985]. The spermatogenic stages in which the toxicity of MAA is induced are on the patchytene spermatocytes immediately before and during meiotic division, which are Stages XII-XIV of the cycle in the rat and the early pachytene spermatocytes at stages I-IV of the cycle. Dead germ cells can be seen as soon as 12 hours after the treatment of MAA [Casarett &amp; Doull&rsquo;s 7th edition]. &nbsp;
""" ;
	mmo:0000000	"""The weights of testes of MAA-treated rats were measured to detect the testicular atrophy [Foster, 1983]. Since zinc concentration has been shown to play an important role in the production of testicular injury by compounds, the effects of EGME and MAA on urinary zinc excretion and testicular zinc content was examined [Foster, 1983]. Testis were fixed for observations for light microscopy or transmission electron microscopy [McDowell, 1976, Mercantepe, 2018]. The testicular tissue structure was observed whether there are normal germinal epithelial cells and Leydig cells [Mercantepe, 2018]. Changes in sperm were measured by computer-assisted sperm analysis [Foote, 1995]. For the testis cell analysis, fresh testes were dispersed using a two-stage enzymatic digestion and incubated in BSA containing collagenase and DNase I [Wade, 2006]. The seminiferous tubules were further digested and cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol [Wade, 2006]. Relative proportions of spermatogenic cell populations were assessed in fixed cells using a flow cytometeric method [Wade, 2006]. The principle of the test is that spermatogenic cells, as they differentiate from normal diploid spermatogonial stem cells through to mature spermatozoa with a highly condensed haploid complement of DNA, progress through various intermediate stages with differing nuclear DNA content and cellular content of mitochondria. Relative proportions of cells in each population were calculated with WinList software [Wade, 2006]. For the assessment of sperm morphology, eosin-stained sperm collected from the cauda epididymis were smeared onto two glass slides per sample, air-dried, and cover-slipped. At least 200 sperm on each slide were examined for the proportion of sperm with abnormal head (overhooked, blunt hook, banana-shaped, amorphous, or extremely oversized) or tail (twisted, bent, corkscrew, double. multiple) by one individual unaware of animal number or treatment [Wade, 2006]. For the measurement of the total number of condensed spermatids per testis, a weighed portion of the parenchyma from the left testis, as representative of the whole organ as possible, was homogenized [Wade, 2006]. For the measurement of the total number of sperm in the cauda epididymis, whole cauda and associated sperm suspension in DPBS were thawed on ice and homogenized [Wade, 2006]. Sperm or homogenization-resistant spermatid nuclei densities were calculated from the average number of nuclei and were expressed as total or as per gram of epididymis or testis weight [Wade, 2006]. For the determination of total LDH and LDH-X in supernatant of the homogenized testis fragment, enzyme activity was measured by monitoring extinction of NAD absorbance [Wade, 2006].

Testicular sperm counts and daily sperm production were determined by counting the total number of spermatids per testis, and divided by the testicular weight to give the results in spermatids per gram of testis [Oishi, 2001]. For the detection of apoptosis, the testes were fixed in modified Davidson fix for 48 hrs, postfixed for 24 hrs in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin.

	dcterms:description	"""Site of action:

CYP7B is expressed in different organs including&nbsp;liver, prostate and brain.

How does it work :

CYP7B is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. It is involved in steroidogenic pathways as well as in the synthesis of bile acids. In the brain, it is involved in neurosteroids synthesis.

In the brain, the reactions catalyzed by CYP7B are :&nbsp;


	Probably in all vertebrates: Pregnenolone into 7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone and its stereoisomer 7&beta;-hydroxypregnenolone (bird only) (R08943)&nbsp;(Matsunaga et al., 2004; Rose et al., 1997; Tsutsui et al., 2008)
	Proven in mouse and human: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to 7&alpha;-hydroxy-DHEA and its stereoisomer 7&beta;-hydroxy-DHEA (Martin et al., 2004; Weihua et al., 2002).&nbsp;


In the human and mouse liver, CYP7B is responsible for (Toll et al., 1994):&nbsp;


	5-cholesten-3-beta, 25(S)-diol into Cholest-5-ene-3 beta-7 alpha, 25-thiol (R07209&nbsp;R08723),
	Cholest-5-ene-3 beta, 26-diol into 7 alpha, 27-dihydroxycholesterol (R07372 R08724),
	3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoate into 3 beta, 7 alpha-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoate (R08727 R08728).
	It is expressed in the chicken liver and is probably involved in the same reactions (Handschin et al., 2005).&nbsp;


In the prostate:


	Proven for human and rat: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to 7&alpha;-hydroxy-DHEA and 7&beta;-hydroxy-DHEA (Martin et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2004).&nbsp;

	Mixed function oxidase catalytic activity. These assays have been thoroughly reviewed by Cederbaum (2014). The paper describes preparation of microsomes from both liver homogenates and cell cultures for testing Cyp2E1 activity. Briefly, the ratio of 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone/chlorzoxazone can be used to estimate levels of CYP2E1 in humans (Girre, et al. 1994). In addition, the oxidation of para-nitrophenol (PNP) to para nitrocatechol is an efficient and relatively specific assay to determine catalytic activity dependent on CYP2E1 [e.g., (Koop 1986, Koop, et al. 1989, Reinke and Moyer 1985)]. Other assays are described within the review article by Cederbaum.
	Western blot or Immunohistochemistry.&nbsp; Following chemical treatment, Cyp2E1 protein levels should increase if it is involved in the metabolism of that substrate. Western blot (of protein extracted from liver or cultured cells) or immunohistochemistry (of fixed liver or cultured cells) using anti-Cyp2E1 antibodies is the most straightforward approach for directly measuring increased levels of Cyp2E1.
	HepG2 cells. A compound&rsquo;s Cyp2E1-dependence can be determined by comparing toxic effects in HepG2 versus HepG2-E47 cells. HepG2 cells are immortalized human hepatoma cells that do not express Cyp2E1; whereas, HepG2-E47 cells over-express Cyp2E1 (by recombinant retroviral infection). Chemicals that are metabolically activated by Cyp2E1 will cause cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in the E47 cells only. Toxicity can be blocked by treatment with antioxidants or Cyp2E1 inhibitors. Toxicity is exacerbated when glutathione is depleted (Wu and Cederbaum 2005) (e.g., ethanol (Cederbaum, et al. 2001, Chen and Cederbaum 1998, Chen, et al. 1998, Dai, et al. 1993).
	Measurement of chemical oxidation by Cyp2E1 in liver microsomes; described in the methodology review by Cederbaum (Cederbaum 2014). Reactions use specific probes to confirm that the compound undergoes oxidation, and that this oxidation reaction is catalyzed by Cyp2E1. See also: (Koop 1986, Koop, et al. 1989, Reinke and Moyer 1985).
	Cyp2E1 knock-out mouse. Chemical exposures in knockout mice are conducted and the production of the anticipated metabolites is measured. Lack of metabolite production indicates that Cyp2E1 is required for the chemical&rsquo;s metabolism. Effects in knock-out mice are always measured in reference to wild-type (control) mice, which allows investigators to attribute the altered phenotype to gene product that has been knocked-out. Studies in Cyp2E1 knockout mice include: carbon tetrachloride (Wong, et al. 1998), acetone (Bondoc, et al. 1999), benzene (Powley and Carlson 2001), thioacetamide (Chilakapati, et al. 2007), trichloroethylene (Kim and Ghanayem 2006), acrylonitrile (El Hadri, et al. 2005), urethane (Hoffler, et al. 2003, Hoffler and Ghanayem 2005), acetaminophen (Lee, et al. 1996, Zaher, et al. 1998), and ethanol (Bardag-Gorce, et al. 2000).
	Humanized Cyp2E1 mice. Two transgenic mice with human Cyp2E1 have been created. The first mouse reproduces and develops normally, and demonstrates Cyp2E1-dependent toxicity (Morgan, et al. 2002). However, these mice express human and endogenous Cyp2E1, which is not ideal. A true &lsquo;humanized&rsquo; Cyp2E1 transgenic mouse was produced by the Gonzalez lab in which the endogenous Cyp2E1 gene was replaced with the human Cyp2E1 gene (Cheung, et al. 2005, Cheung and Gonzalez 2008). Studies in these mice are conducted in order to provide evidence that the Cyp2E1-dependent effects observed in experimental animals will also occur in humans.
	2-Piperidone. Z-Piperidone is a newly proposed biomarker of Cyp2E1 activity that is detected in urine (Cheng, et al. 2013).

	dcterms:description	"""Cytotoxicity occurs through three main mechanisms: apoptosis, necrosis, and necroptosis. (1) During programmed cell death, apoptotic cells are &lsquo;disassembled&rsquo; and cellular components &lsquo;bleb&rsquo; off as large vacuoles, which can be eliminated by phagocytosis. Apoptosis is activated via the extrinsic pathway (mediated through a death receptor, TNFR) or intrinsic pathway (mediated through the mitochondria), each of which activate the caspase cascade (Riedl and Shi 2004). (2) Necrosis is an unregulated, accidental form of cell death that occurs when severe damage to cellular components causes the cell to die abruptly and spill its contents into the extracellular space.&nbsp; Released cellular components include damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that trigger an inflammatory response. (3) The third type of cell death is necroptosis, or programmed necrosis, which uses the same death receptor that is upstream to the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, but signaling results in a necrotic outcome. The decision for TNFR to signal for apoptosis or necroptosis is thought to depend on the receptor protein kinases 1 and 3 (RIP1, RIP3), which are part of the protein complex that forms on the intra-cellular portion of the TNFR. Activation of caspase-8 cleaves the RIP1-RIP3 complex and favours apoptosis, whereas inhibition of caspase-8 favours the RIP1-RIP3 complex (called the &lsquo;necrosome&rsquo;). As per standard necrosis, necroptosis results in DAMP release, which triggers inflammation. Necroptosis has been reviewed (Vandenabeele, et al. 2010). Cell death mechanisms in the liver and in liver disease have also been reviewed (Eguchi, et al. 2014, Luedde, et al. 2014).

The mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is an important process that leads to necrosis or apoptosis. When the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is triggered (ASK1MKK4JNK), Bax is recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane (Youle and Strasser 2008). Bax triggers the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MTP), through which cytochrome c is released, which triggers the caspase cascade and apoptosis. Alternatively, when the MTP opens across the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, mitochondrial swelling and decoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (i.e., loss of ATP generation) leads to cell death by necrosis (Pessayre, et al. 2010, Rasola and Bernardi 2007).

Facultative stem cells are functional, differentiated cells that will dedifferentiate in response to tissue damage, thereby becoming a population of progenitor cells that can redifferentiate to replace multiple lost cell types.In a process known as ductal expansion, BECs dedifferentiate into oval cells, which then redifferentiate into hepatocytes or BECs in order to regenerate damaged liver tissue. Liver regeneration has been reviewed (Mao, et al. 2014, Stanger 2015, Yanger and Stanger 2011).

At the molecular level, two dimeric transcription factors, AP-1 (particularly the c-Jun monomer) and NF-kappaB, are key players during liver regeneration. While neither is expressed in normal liver tissue, they are upregulated during normal hepatic regeneration, and are required for regeneration (Alcorn, et al. 1990, Cressman, et al. 1994, FitzGerald, et al. 1995). Indeed, rodents lacking AP-1 or NF-kappaB display impaired liver regeneration, often leading to death (Behrens, et al. 2002, Schrum, et al. 2000). Both NF-kappaB and c-Jun (AP-1) are required for embryonic liver development, and a loss of either one is embryonic lethal due to widespread cell death and liver degeneration (Behrens, et al. 2002, Eferl, et al. 1999, Jochum, et al. 2001, Li, et al. 1999, Rudolph, et al. 2000).

The level of CYP2E1 in the brain of a rat is significantly low, only 25% of what is found in rat liver cells. Inside a brain cell of a rat the highest level of CYP2E1 is found in the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. In human brain samples expression of CYP2E1 was found in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. CYP2E1 is also known to activate toxic related compounds (see stressors).

After incubation with several proteins the drugs attached to the proteins are separated from the rest of the free proteins with the use of the tag. Next the proteins which are altered by the drug can be identified with proteomics. A LC/MS/MS technique is used.

Three effectors are released: ATF6, IRE1 and PERK. During the release chaperone BiP (GRP78) is removed from the effectors which maintain them in inactive state.

Examples of proteins which are involved in apoptosis are the proteins p53, Bcl-2, JNK, and several caspases.

These bodies are cleared by macrophages or other cells where the degradation process starts within heteorphagosomes.

An older but effective technique it the annexin V &ndash; affinity assay. The principle of this assay is the high affinity binding between annexin V and phosphatidylserine. In a vital cell there is a membrane lipid asymmetry where phosphatidylserine molecules are facing the cytosol. During apoptosis the membrane lipid asymmetry is lost, and the phosphatidylserine molecules are expressed in the outer membrane. When annexin-V is present in combination with Ca2+ it binds with high affinity to phosphatidylserine. With a hapten label at the annexin-V this process can be detected.

Other techniques are the detection of cleaved caspase-3, which could be done with a western blot or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.

There are two major systems involved in the removal of damaged cellular structures (e.g. defective mitochondria) and misfolded or damaged proteins, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy&ndash;lysosome pathway (ALP). These processes are highly energy demanding and highly susceptible to oxidative stress. Upon mitochondrial dysfunction UPS and ALP functions are compromised resulting in increased protein aggregation and impaired intracellular protein/organelles transport (e.g. Zaltieri et al., 2015; Song and Cortopassi, 2015; Fujita et al., 2014; Esteves et al., 2011; Sherer et al., 2002).

Impaired proteostasis with formation of misfolded &alpha;-synuclein aggregates deregulates microtubule assembly and stability with reduction in axonal transport and impairment of mithocondrial trafficking and energy supply (Esposito et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2007; Borland et al. 2008; O&rsquo;Malley 2010; Fujita et al. 2014; Weihofen et al. 2009).

Pathological consequences of these deregulated process include interference with the function of synapses, formation of toxic aggregates of proteins, impaired energy metabolism and turnover of mitochondria and chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress; all eventually leading to degeneration of DA neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway (Fujita et al. 2010, Shulman et al. 2011, Dauer et al. 2003, Orimo et al.2008, Raff et al. 2005; Schwarz 2015).

	dcterms:description	"""Cells of the innate (microglia and astrocytes) and adaptive (infiltrating monocytes and lymphocytes) immune system of the brain have, like other immune cells (in peripheral tissues), various ways to kill neighboring cells. This is in part due to evolutionary-conserved mechanisms evolved to kill virus-infected cells or tumor cells; in part it is a bystander phenomenon due to the release of mediators that should activate other cells and contribute to the killing of invading microorganisms. An exaggerated or unbalanced activation of immune cells can thus lead to parenchymal (neuronal) cell death (Gehrmann et al., 1995). Mediators known to have such effects, and that are also known to be produced during inflammation in the brain comprise components of the complement system and cytokines/death receptor ligands triggering programmed cell death (Dong and Benveniste, 2001). Besides these specific signals, various secreted proteases (e.g. matrix metalloproteases), lipid mediators (e.g. ceramide or gangliosides) or reactive oxygen species can contribute to bystander death of neurons (Chao et al., 1995; Nakajima et al., 2002; Brown and Bal-Price, 2003; Kraft and Harry, 2011; Taetzsch and Block, 2013). Especially the equimolar production of superoxide and NO from glial cells can lead to high steady state levels of peroxynitrite, which is a very potent cytotoxicant (Yuste et al., 2015). Already damaged neurons, with an impaired anti-oxidant defence system, are more sensitive to such mediators. An important role of microglia in the brain is the removal of cell debris (Xu et al., 2015). Healthy cells continuously display anti-&ldquo;eat me&rdquo; signals, while damaged and stressed neurons/neurites display &ldquo;eat-me&rdquo; signals that may be recognbized by microglia as signal to start phagocytosis (Neher et al., 2012), thus accelerating the loss of DA neurites in the striatum. Activated microglia surrounding DAergic neurons in PD express the M1 neurodegenerative phenotype (Hunot et al., 1999), which promote proliferation and function of CD4+ T cells (for review Appel et al., 2010), which in turn induce DA neuron toxicity, as assessed by experiments with immunodeficient mice (Brochard et al., 2009). Possible infiltration of other myeloid cells, such as monocytes or macrophages through a compromised blood-brain barrier, may also be involved in phagocytosis and neurodegeneration (Depboylu et al., 2012&nbsp;; Pey et al., 2014).

	dcterms:description	"""Several chemokines and chemokines receptors (fraktalkine, CD200) control the neuron-microglia interactions and a loss of this control on the side of neurons can trigger microglial reactivity without any further positive signal required (Blank and Prinz, 2013; Chapman et al., 2000; Streit et al., 2001). Upon neuronal injury, signals termed &ldquo;Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs)&rdquo; are released by damaged neurons to promote microglial reactivity (Marin-Teva et al., 2011; Katsumoto et al., 2014). These are for instance detected by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (for review, see Hayward and Lee, 2014). TLR-2 functions as a master sensing receptor to detect neuronal death and tissue damage in many different neurological conditions including nerve transection injury, traumatic brain injury and hippocampal excitotoxicity (Hayward and Lee, 2014). Astrocytes, the other cellular actor of neuroinflammation besides microglia (Ranshoff and Brown, 2012) are also able to sense tissue injury via e.g. TLR-3 (Farina et al., 2007; Rossi, 2015), and neuronal injury can result in astrocytic activation (Efremova, 2015).

The SNpc can be particularly vulnarable to the inflammatory process; its contains more microglia than astrocytes when compared with other areas of the brain and this can promote stronger neuroinfammation (Mena et al. 2008, Kim et al. 2000).

	dcterms:description	"""Neurons are characterized by the presence of neurites, the formation of action potentials, and the release and re-uptake of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The presence of long extensions implies a significant enlargement of total cell surface. In combination with the transmission of action potentials that require a continuous maintenance of active transport processes across the membrane, the steady state energy demand of these neurons is significantly higher compared with non-neuronal cells. Dopaminergic (DA) neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) that project into the striatum are unique with respect of the total length of their neurites and the number of synapses that are significantly higher compared with other neuronal cell types (Bolam et al., 2012). Besides this complex morphology DA neurons have a distinctive physiological phenotype that could contribute to their vulnerability (Surmeier et al., 2010). Other features such as high energy demand, high calcium flux, dopamine autoxidation process as well as high content of iron and high content of microglia makes these DA neurons at vulnerable population of cells to oxidative stress produced by mitochondrial dysfunction. These architectural features of SNpc DA neurons render this cell type as particularly vulnerable to impairments in energy supply. Mitochondrial dysfunction, either evoked by environmental toxins such as the complex I inhibitor rotenone or MPTP, by oxidative modifications of components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, or by genetic impairments of mitochondrial ATP generation hence have direct influence on the function and integrity of SNpc DA neurons.

The loss of nigrostriatal DA neurons leads to a decline in the levels of DA in the striatum (Koller et al. 1992). Striatal DA is involved in the modulation of extrapyramidal motor control circuits. A decline in striatal DA leads to an overactivation of the two principal basal ganglia output nuclei (GPi/STN). Therefore, the inhibitory GABAergic neurons that project to thalamo-cortical structures are overactivated and inhibit cortical pyramidal motor output performance. This inhibited output activity is responsible for key clinical symptoms of PD such as bradykinesia and rigor.

The shortened chain fatty acids (&lt;20C) can then be transported to the mitochondria to undergo mitochondrial beta-oxidation for complete metabolism of the carbon substrate for cellular energy production (Desvergne and Wahli 1999).&nbsp; Mitochondrial fatty acid beta oxidation catabolizes short, medium and long chain fatty acids (&lt;C20) into acetyl-CoA and ATP.&nbsp; The production of acetyl-CoA monomers is important as they serve as fundamental units for metabolic energy production (ATP) via the citric acid cycle followed by electron-transport chain mediated oxidative phosphorylation (Nelson and Cox, 2000A). Acetyl-CoA is also a fundamental units of energy storage via gluconeogenesis (Nelson and Cox, 2000B) and lipogenesis (Nelson and Cox, 2000C). The liver plays a key role in processing the fundamental energy substrate, acetyl-CoA, into metabolic currencies that contribute to the systemic cellular energy needs of the whole organism.&nbsp; The liver represents a key organ involved in systemic energy distribution given its ability to synthesize glucose (an ability shared only with the kidney, Gerich et al 2001) as well as its exclusive role in the generation of ketone bodies (Cahill 2006, Sengupta et al 2010, Kersten 2014). &nbsp;This is especially important for the metabolic energy needs of the brain which can only use glucose and the ketone body, &beta;-hydroxybutyrate for cellular energy production (Cahill 2006, Owen 2005, Kersten 2014).&nbsp; Therefore, the KE, &ldquo;ketogenesis (production of ketone bodies)&rdquo; is critical to supporting general systemic energy homeostasis in fasting events (Cahill 2006, Evans et al 2004, Sengupta et al 2010).

After two to three days of fasting in humans, dietary glucose has been long-since expended and contribution to blood glucose from glycogen metabolism is reduced to zero (Cahill 2006).&nbsp; At this point, about two fifths of fatty acid metabolism in the whole body is dedicated to hepatic ketogenesis, largely in support of the energy demands of the brain, however the brain is still significantly supported by glucose derived from gluconeogenesis (Cahill 2006).&nbsp; PPAR&alpha; knockout mice that were either fasted or exercised to exhaustion had diminished capacity for maintaining energetic substrates in serum (glucose and lactate) while showing diminished capacity for fatty acid oxidation (serum nonesterified fatty acids) and decreased ketogenesis resulting in hypoketonemia (decreased serum &beta;-hydroxybutyrate) relative to wild types (Muoio et al 2002).&nbsp; As fatty acid stores are depleted or become unusable (as in the PPAR&alpha; knockout condition described above), gluconeogenesis from other substrates becomes increasingly important including muscle protein catabolism in situ for supporting muscle function as well as releasing glutamine (Marliss et al 1971) and alanine (Felig et al 1970A) which can be recycled to glucose by gluconeogenesis in the kidney (Goodman et al 1966, Kashiwaya et al 1994, Cahill 2006). &nbsp;Renal gluconeogenesis from glutamine and alanine supports two fifths of new glucose production while the remaining three fifths is produced in liver from, (a) alanine derived from muscle and nonhepatic splanchnic bed, (b) recycled lactate and pyruvate from red blood cells and renal medulla, (c) glycerol from adipose lipolysis and (d) small amounts of &beta;-hydroxybutyrate are recycled to glucose (Cahill 2006).&nbsp; Blood concentrations of alanine exert control over hepatic glucose production and thus also represent a diagnostic of alanine contribution from muscle to support gluconeogenesis (Cahill 2006, Felig et al 1970B).&nbsp; In prolonged starvation events, the catabolism of muscle protein (KE6) for gluconeogenesis in order to support systemic energy needs results in loss of muscle mass which contributes to loss of overall body weight.&nbsp; Although it has not yet been investigated experimentally, it is plausible based on the results described above for Muoio et al (2002) that diminished PPAR&alpha; signaling capacity could exacerbate muscle wasting in long-term fasting and/or malnutrition events.

Dynamic energy budget theory has provided useful insights on how organisms take up, assimilate and then allocate energy to various fundamental biological processes including maintenance, growth, development and reproduction (Nisbet et al 2000).&nbsp; Regarding energy allocation, somatic maintenance (maintaining homeostasis) must first be met before then growth may occur, followed by maturation and then finally, surplus energy is dedicated to reproduction (Nisbet et al 2000).&nbsp; If somatic maintenance cannot be sustained, energy substrates must be generated using standing biomass from non-essential organs, such as skeletal muscle, to maintain homeostasis ultimately leading to the ultimate AO of weight loss (Cahill 2006).&nbsp; As an example of the importance of energy allocation to ecological fitness, a review by Martin et al (1987) demonstrated that energy availability (availability of food) was the predominant limiting factor in reproductive success and survival for both young and parents in a broad life history review&nbsp; for bird species.&nbsp; This is a likely scenario for many organisms.

	dcterms:description	"""The ovarian cycle irregularities impact on reproductive capacity of the females that may result in  impaired fertility:
1.	Irregular cycles may reflect impaired ovulation. Extended vaginal estrus usually indicates that the female cannot spontaneously achieve the ovulatory surge of LH (Huang and Meites, 1975). The persistence of regular vaginal cycles after treatment does not necessarily indicate that ovulation occurred, because luteal tissue may form in follicles that have not ruptured. However, that effect should be reflected in reduced fertility. Conversely, subtle alterations of cyclicity can occur at doses below those that alter fertility (Gray et al., 1989).
2.	Persistent or constant vaginal cornification (or vaginal estrus) may result from one or several effects. Typically, in the adult, if the vaginal epithelium becomes cornified and remains so in response to toxicant exposure, it is the result of the agent‚Äôs estrogenic properties (i.e., DES or methoxychlor), or the ability of the agent to block ovulation. In the latter case, the follicle persists and endogenous estrogen levels bring about the persistent vaginal cornification. Histologically, the ovaries in persistent estrus will be atrophied following exposure to estrogenic substances. In contrast, the ovaries of females in which ovulation has been blocked because of altered gonadotropin secretion will contain several large follicles and no corpora lutea. Females in constant estrus may be sexually receptive regardless of the mechanism responsible for this altered ovarian condition. However, if ovulation has been blocked by the treatment, an LH surge may be induced by mating (Brown-Grant et al., 1973; Smith, E.R. and Davidson, 1974) and a pregnancy or pseudopregnancy may ensue. The fertility of such matings is reduced (Cooper et al., 1994). 
3.	Significant delays in ovulation can result in increased embryonic abnormalities and pregnancy loss (Fugo and Butcher, 1966; Cooper et al., 1994).
4.	Persistent diestrus indicates temporary or permanent cessation of follicular development and
ovulation, and thus at least temporary infertility. 
5.	Prolonged vaginal diestrus, or anestrus, may be indicative of agents (e.g., polyaromatic hydrocarbons) that interfere with follicular development or deplete the pool of primordial follicles (Mattison and Nightingale, 1980) or agents such as atrazine that interrupt gonadotropin support of the ovary (Cooper et al., 1996). Pseudopregnancy is another altered endocrine state reflected by persistent diestrus. The ovaries of anestrous females are atrophic, with few primary follicles and an unstimulated uterus (Huang and Meites, 1975). Serum estradiol and progesterone are abnormally low.
6.	Lengthening of the cycle may be a result of increased duration of either estrus or diestrus.

For instance, whole-cell in vitro recordings in the rat basolateral amygdala (BLA) showed that RDX reduces the frequency and amplitude of GABAA receptor mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and the amplitude of GABA-evoked postsynaptic currents, whereas in extracellular field recordings from the BLA, RDX induced prolonged, seizure-like neuronal discharges (Williams et al. 2011). These pieces of cellular level evidence support that binding to the GABAA receptor convulsant site is the primary mechanism of seizure induction by RDX and that the key event of reduction of GABAergic inhibitory transmission in the amygdala is involved in the generation of RDX-induced seizures.

	dcterms:description	"""GABAA receptors mediate two distinct forms of inhibition, phasic and tonic. The first consists of fast inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), regulating point-to-point communication between neurons. The second consists of a persistent inhibitory conductance that plays a crucial role in regulating the membrane potential and network excitability (Farrant and Nusser 2005). In the case of phasic inhibition, synaptic GABAA receptors, facing presynaptic release sites, are activated by a brief exposure to a high concentration of GABA released by exocytosis of presynaptic vesicles. Once released, GABA diffuses throughout the neuropil before being taken up by selective plasma membrane transporters, which contribute to the clearance of the neurotransmitter (Cherubini and Conti 2001). In the case of tonic inhibition, extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, localized away from the synapses, are persistently exposed to low concentration of &ldquo;ambient&rdquo; GABA.

Fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is mediated primarily by the neurotransmitters GABA and glycine. Glycine is predominantly used in the spinal cord and the brain stem, whereas GABA is more commonly used in the brain (Jentsch et al. 2002). As the dominant charge carrier through GABA-A receptors, chloride is directly implicated in the efficacy of fast neuronal synaptic inhibition (Prescott 2014). The binding of GABA to GABAA receptors opens intrinsic anion channels, which leads to a Cl&minus; influx that hyperpolarizes the neuron and thereby inhibits postsynaptic neuronal activity in the adult CNS (Jentsch et al. 2002). Neurons communicate&nbsp;through action potentials along their axons, and those action potentials are electrical events that depend&nbsp;on the movements of ions, particularly sodium and potassium, across the neuronal cell membrane (Jefferys 2010). Postsynaptic conductance changes and the potential changes that accompany them alter the probability that an action potential will be produced in the postsynaptic cell. Postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) are called excitatory (or EPSPs) if they increase the likelihood of a postsynaptic action potential occurring, and inhibitory (or IPSPs) if they decrease this likelihood (Purves et al. 2001). Given that most neurons receive inputs from both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, it is important to understand more precisely the mechanisms that determine whether a particular synapse excites or inhibits its postsynaptic partner. In order to generate large EPSPs underlying depolarization shift (cause of interictal spike discharge or epileptic seizure), the normal small EPSPs must be amplified (Dichter and Ayala 1987). Blocking of chloride channel by non-competitive blockers at the picrotoxin convulsant site on GABAA receptors reduces IPSPs or increases the probability of firing of the neuron, causing an enhancement of excitatory postsynaptic action potentials (EPSPs) (Dichter and Ayala 1987).

This leads to the increased, abnormal neuron firing that causes a wave of depolarization throughout the brain/neuronal tissue. At the level of single neurons, epileptiform activity consists of sustained neuronal depolarization resulting in a burst of action potentials, a plateau-like depolarization associated with completion of the action potential burst, and then a rapid repolarization followed by hyperpolarization. This sequence is called the paroxysmal depolarizing shift. The bursting activity resulting from the relatively prolonged depolarization of the neuronal membrane is due to influx of extracellular Ca2+, which leads to the opening of voltage-dependent Na+ channels, influx of Na+, and generation of repetitive action potentials. The subsequent hyperpolarizing afterpotential is mediated by iGABA receptors and Cl- influx, or by K+ efflux, depending on the cell type (Bromfield et al 2006).

In acute focal epilepsy, during the ID, thousands of neurons in the focus synchronously undergo an unusually large depolarization (the paroxysmal depolarizing shift or PDS), superimposed on which is a burst of action potentials. The PDS is followed by a hyperpolarizing potential (the post-PDS HP) and neuronal inhibition. In areas surrounding the focus, many neurons are inhibited during the ID. In distant projection areas, neurons can be excited briefly but more often are inhibited during the ID, according to their synaptic interactions. Axons that end within the focus generate action potentials, which can &quot;backfire&quot; and propagate antidromically. In addition, during the ID, at the site of the focus, extracellular levels of K+ increase and levels of Ca2+ decrease, presumably because of exit of K+ from and entry of Ca2+ into neuronal processes during the intense neuronal activity.

On the other hand, proBDNF binds to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and activates RhoA that regulates actin cytoskeleton polymerization resulting in apoptosis (Lee et al., 2001; Miller and Kaplan, 2001; Murray and Holmes, 2011).

Upon injury causing neuronal death (mainly necrotic), signals termed Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) are released by damaged neurons and promote microglial reactivity (Marin-Teva et al., 2011; Katsumoto et al., 2014). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern-recognition receptors that recognize specific pathogen- and danger-associated molecular signatures (PAMPs and DAMPs) and subsequently initiate inflammatory and immune responses. Microglial cells express TLRs, mainly TLR-2, which can detect neuronal cell death (for review, see Hayward and Lee, 2014). TLR-2 functions as a master sentry receptor to detect neuronal death and tissue damage in many different neurological conditions including nerve trans-section injury, traumatic brain injury and hippocampal excitotoxicity (Hayward and Lee, 2014). Astrocytes, the other cellular mediator of neuroinflammation (Ranshoff and Brown, 2012) are also able to sense tissue injury via TLR-3 (Farina et al., 2007; Rossi, 2015).

Chronic neuroinflammation can cause secondary damage (Kraft and Harry, 2011). The mechanisms by which neuroinflammation (i.e. activated microglia and astrocytes) can kill neurons and induce/exacerbate the neurodegenerative process has been suggested to include the release of nitric oxide that causes inhibition of neuronal respiration, ROS and RNS production, and rapid glutamate release resulting in excitotoxic death of neurons (Brown &amp; Bal-Price, 2003; Kraft &amp; Harry, 2011; Taetzsch &amp; Block, 2013). Glial reactivity is also associated with excessive production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that not only affect neurons, but also have detrimental feedback effects on microglia (Heneka et al., 2014). For example, sustained exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or to other pro-inflammatory mediators was shown to restrict microglial phagocytosis of misfiled and aggregated proteins (Sheng et al., 2003). Systemic immune challenge during pregnancy leading to microglial activation caused increased deposition of amyloid plaques and tau hyperphosphorylation in aged mice (Krstic et al., 2012, 2013), suggesting that neuroinflammation is involved in the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formation. There is further evidence that the formation of neurofibrillary tangles is caused by microglial cell-driven neuroinflammation, since LPS-induced systemic inflammation increased tau pathology (Kitazawa et al., 2005).

Bilateral injections of amyloid-b peptide in the frontal cortex of rats leads to progressive decline in memory and neurodegeneration in hippocampus (for review see Eslamizade et al., 2016). Recent findings have shown that soluble forms of Ab rather than insoluble forms (fibrils and plaques) are associated with memory impairment in early stages of Alzheimer&#39;s disease (for review see Salgado-Puga and Pena-Ortega, 2015). Several lines of evidence suggest that the small oligomeric forms of Ab and tau may act synergistically to promote synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer&#39;s disease (for review see Guerrerro-Minoz et al., 2015). Some reports proposed the concept of imbalance between production and clearance of Ab42 and related Ab peptides, as an initiating factor inducing hyperphosphorylation of tau and leading to neuritic dystrophy and synaptic dysfunction (for review see Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). Recent trials of three different antibodies against amyloid peptides have suggested a slowing of cognitive decline in post hoc analyses of mild Alzheimer subjects (for review see Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). Therefore cognitive deficits may be related to the level and extent of classical Alzheimer pathology landmarks, but it is also influenced by neurodegeneration (for review see Braskie and Thompson, 2013).

	dcterms:description	"""According to its definition, neurodegeneration includes the death of neurons. Therefore, the KER describing the link between cell death and neuroinflammation is also applicable to this KER. However in neurodegenerative diseases and in Alzheimer&#39;s disease in particular, neurodegneration is associated with accumulation of modified/aggregated proteins (insoluble amyloid; hyperphosphorylated tau), which are recognised as potential triggers of neuroinflammation:

Proteinopathies associated with neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) may be sensed as damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and thus activate microglia within the CNS. In animal neurodegeneration models and post-mortem brain samples from&nbsp; patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders often revealed the presence of activated microglia and the accumulation of inflammatory mediators at the lesion sites, which suggests a continuous crosstalk between the brain immune system and the injured neurons during neurodegeneration. Microglial are typically activated acutely in response to an initial triggering insult, but their continued presence in large numbers around the lesion areas may actually promote neuronal death despite the absence of the initial triggering insult. Inflammatory factors being released by dying neurons and/or actively secreted from the activated microglia aid in maintaining the vicious cycle between activated microglia and damaged neurons (Thundyil and Lim 2015).

The fact that neuronal death can trigger neuroinflammation and that neuroinflammation can, in turn, cause neuronal degeneration, is known as a vicious circle, which is involved in the pathogeny of neurodegenerative diseases (Griffin et al., 1998; McGeer and Mc Geer, 1998; Blasko et al., 2004; Cacquevel et al., 2004; Barbeito et al., 2010; Rubio-Perez and Morillas-Ruiz, 2012; Thundyil and Lim, 2015).

Microglial cells are involved in the clearance of amyloid plaques (Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010), but can also be responsible for amyloid plaque formation (Streit and Sparks, 1997). As aging microglia seem to lose their ability to phagocytose (Floden and Combs, 2011), impaired clearance, as well as active deposition, can both contribute to amyloid plaque accumulation.&nbsp;

However, when a stressor increases the number of apoptotic cells this KE has a negative effect on synaptogenesis as the reduced number of neurons (besides the ones that have been already eliminated through the physiological process of apoptosis) provides limited dendritic fields for receiving synaptic inputs from incoming axons.

The main roles of synapses are the regulation of intercellular communication in the nervous system, and the information flow within neural networks. The connectivity and functionality of neural networks depends on where and when synapses are formed. Therefore, the decreased synapse formation during the process of synaptogenesis is critical and leads to decrease of neural network formation and function in the adult brain.

Synaptic transmission and plasticity require the integrity of the anatomical substrate. The connectivity of axons emanating from one set of cells to post-synaptic side of synapse on the dendrites of the receiving cells must be intact for effective communication between neurons. Changes in the placement of cells within the network due to delays in neuronal migration, the absence of a full formation of dendritic arbors and spine upon which synaptic contacts are made, and the lagging of transmission of electrical impulses due to insufficient myelination will individually and cumulatively impair synaptic function. Since synaptogenesis follows the early neurodevelopmental processes such as neuronal and glial cells proliferation, migration, alterations in dendritic arborisation etc., therefore, it encompasses, possible changes in these early stages of brain development that could also be triggered under hypothyroidism, leading to defective synaptogenesis and resulting in abnormal function of neuronal network function. These anatomical alterations are responsible for many structural anomalies reported in various regions of the brain following severe developmental hypothyroidism. Although the primary evidence of synaptic transmission impairments in hypothyroid models have come from studying the hippocampus, it is assumed that the role thyroid hormones play in these processes is likely similar across different brain regions. Altered hippocampal structure induced by decreased TH levels impacts neurogenesis in the developing hippocampus or cortex, contributing to deficits in synaptic function.

	dcterms:description	"""Learning and memory is one of the outcomes of the functional expression of neurons and neural networks from mammalian to invertebrates. Damage or destruction of neurons by chemical compounds during development when they are in the process of synapses formation, integration and formation of neural networks, will derange the organization and function of these networks, thereby setting the stage for subsequent impairment of learning and memory. Exposure to the potential developmental toxicants during neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis will increase risk of functional neuronal network damage leading to learning and memory impairment.

Impairments in learning and memory are measured using behavioral techniques. It is well accepted that these alterations in behavior are the result of structural or functional changes in neurocircuitry. Functional impairments are often measured using field potentials of critical synaptic circuits in hippocampus and cortex. A number of studies have been performed in rodent models that reveal deficits in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus as a result of developmental thyroid insufficiency (Wang et al., 2012; Oerbeck et al., 2003; Wheeler et al., 2011; Wheeler et al., 2015; Willoughby et al., 2014; Davenport and Dorcey, 1972; Tamasy et al., 1986; Akaike, 1991; Axelstad et al., 2008; Gilbert and Sui, 2006; Gilbert et al., 2016; Gilbert, 2011; Gilbert et al., 2016). A well-established functional readout of memory at the synaptic level is known as long-term potentiation (LTP) (i.e., a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity). Deficiencies in LTP are generally regarded as potential substrates of learning and memory impairments. In rodent models where synaptic function is impaired by TH deficiencies, deficits in hippocampus-mediated memory are also prevalent (Gilbert and Sui, 2006; Gilbert et al., 2016; Gilbert, 2011; Gilbert et al., 2016).

The selenoprotein family composes of proteins with diverse functionality, however, several are classified as antioxidant enzymes (Reeves, 2009) and this function is of particular importance for this KER. Relevant for this KER there are two well-studied functional selenoprotein families which are described to be expressed in the brain; (i) the Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) family, involved in detoxification of peroxidases; (ii) the Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR) family, which is involved in the regeneration of reduced thioredoxin (Pillai, 2014). However, there is also a number of other selenoproteins with diverse functions, from selenium transport (SelP), to ER stress response (SelK, M, N, S, T and Sep15, as well as DIO2) (Pisoschi, 2015; Reeves, 2009). Due to their described functionalities (summarized in table below) an increased oxidative stress as a consequence of interference with selenoprotein function, through binding to active-site thiol-/selenol groups will primarily concern the interference with proteins of the GPx- and TrxR families, as well as SelH, K, S, R, W, and P selenoproteins.

Binding to thiol/sulfhydyryl groups of these proteins can firstly result in structural modifications of these proteins, which in turn negatively effects the catalytic capacity and thereby reducing or blocking the metabolic capacity to neutralize reactive oxygen species (Fernandes, 1996; Rajanna, 1995), secondly, SH/SeH binding would also the instrinsic primary antioxidant functionalities of selenoproteins (Kohen, 2002; Pisoschi, 2015).

	dcterms:description	"""In the central nervous system (CNS), glutamate (Glu) is rapidly taken up at the synaptic cleft to mitigate potential excitotoxicity (Meldrum, 2000). Reuptake is carried out by the electrochemical gradient of Glu across the plasma membrane and is accomplished by Glu transporter proteins, referred to as excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). These transporter proteins are predominantly expressed in astrocytes, but they are also be found in other neural cells, such as oligodendrocyte, neuron, and microglia membranes (Danbolt, 2001). Functional Glu transporters are located on cell surface membranes. The activities of these transporters are regulated by a redistribution of these proteins to or from the plasma membrane (Robinson 2002), under the control of several signaling pathways. Five different families of EAATs have been recognized (EAAT1&ndash;EAAT5). They vary in Na+ and/or K+ coupling abilities. Their names differ based on the presence of the transporter in human or in other mammals (see Table 1).

These transporters co-localize with, form physical (co-immunoprecipitable) interactions with, and functionally couple to various &#39;energy-generating&#39; systems, including the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, glycogen metabolizing enzymes, glycolytic enzymes, and mitochondria/mitochondrial proteins. This functional coupling is bi-directional with many of these systems both being regulated by glutamate transport and providing the &#39;fuel&#39; to support glutamate uptake (Robinson and Jackson, 2016). The Na+ gradient, which depends on Na/K ATPase pump and consequently of ATP production and intracellular levels, provides the energy to move Glu from the outside into the cells, accompanied by two Na+ and an H+&nbsp;; at the same time, K+ moves in the opposite direction (Boron and Boulpaep, 2003). Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to a decrease in ATP synthesis, impaired Ca2+ content, and concomitant increase in the levels of ROS and RNS (Beal, 2005). Free radicals, which are electrically unstable, have a central role in several physiological and pathological processes. Both ROS and RNS originate from endogenous and exogenous sources. Mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, phagocytic cells, and others serve as endogenous sources, and environmental factors, such as alcohol, tobacco, pollution, industrial solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, specified medicines, etc. make up the prepondarance of exogenous factors. Significant amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS,) are formed during oxidative phosphorylation, when the greatest amount of ATP is produced. Cellular antioxidants production serves as a countermeasure against this process (Su et al., 2013; Szalardi et al., 2015). Most cells, including astrocytes, have protective mechanisms against ROS, predominantly in the form of the tripeptide thiol, glutathione (GSH) (Hsie et al., 1996). This process stays in a highly sensitive balance. In the specific case when ROS and RNS synthesis exceeds antioxidant synthesis it results in oxidative stress (Reddy, 2006; Ghafouribar et al., 2008; Su et al., 2013; Szalardi et al., 2015; Valko et al., 2007; Yankovskaya et al., 2003; Senoo-Matsuda et al., 2003; &nbsp;Schon and Manfredi, 2003).

	dcterms:description	"""Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS, where it plays key roles in development, learning, memory and response to injury. However, glutamate at high concentrations at the synaptic cleft acts as a toxin, inducing neuronal injury and death (Meldrum, 2000; Ozawa et al., 1998). Glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity has been dubbed as &ldquo;excitotoxicity&rdquo;, referring to the consequence of the overactivation of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)&ndash;type glutamate receptors (cf AOP 48), leading to increased Na+ and Ca2+ influx into neurons (Choi, 1992; Pivovarova &amp; Andrews, 2010). Increased intracellular Ca2+ levels are associated with the generation of oxidative stress and neurotoxicity (Lafon-Cazal, 1993). Accordingly, the control of extracellular levels of glutamate dictates its physiological/pathological actions and this equilibrium is maintained primarily by the action of several glutamate transporters (such as GLAST, GLT1, and EAAC1) located on astrocytic cell membranes, which remove the excitatory neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft, keeping its extracellular concentrations below toxic levels (Anderson and Swanson, 2000; Maragakis and Rothstein, 2001; Szydlowska &amp; Tymianski, 2010).

&nbsp;

In addition to synaptic transmission, physiological stimulation of glutamate receptors can mediate&nbsp;trophic&nbsp;effects and promote neuronal plasticity. During&nbsp;development, NMDA receptors initiate a cascade of signal transduction events and gene expression changes primarily involving Ca2+-mediated signaling, induced by activation of either Ca2+- permeable receptor channels or voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. The consecutive activation of major protein kinase signaling pathways, such as Ras-MAPK/ERK and PI3-K-Akt, contributes to regulation of gene expression through the activation of key transcription factors, such as CREB, SRF, MEF-2, NF-kappaB. Metabotropic glutamate receptors can also engage these signaling pathways, in part by transactivating receptor tyrosine kinases. Indirect effects of glutamate receptor stimulation are due to the release of neurotrophic factors, such as&nbsp;brain&nbsp;derived neurotrophic factor through glutamate-induced release of&nbsp;trophic&nbsp;factors from glia. The&nbsp;trophic&nbsp;effect of glutamate receptor activation is developmental stage-dependent and may play an important role in determining the selective survival of neurons that made proper connections. During this sensitive developmental period, interference with glutamate receptor function may lead to widespread neuronal loss (for review, Balazs, 2006).

	dcterms:description	"""The pioneering work of Kreutzberg and coworkers (1995, 1996) has shown that neuronal injury leads to neuroinflammation, with microglia and astrocyte reactivity. Several chemokines and chemokines receptors (fraktalkine, CD200) control the neuron-microglia interactions, and a loss of this control can trigger microglial reactivity (Blank and Prinz, 2013; Chapman et al., 2000; Streit et al., 2001). Upon injury causing neuronal death (mainly necrotic), signals termed Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) are released by damaged neurons and promote microglial reactivity (Marin-Teva et al., 2011; Katsumoto et al., 2014). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern-recognition receptors that recognize specific pathogen- and danger-associated molecular signatures (PAMPs and DAMPs) and subsequently initiate inflammatory and immune responses. Microglial cells express TLRs, mainly TLR-2, which can detect neuronal cell death (for review, see Hayward and Lee, 2014). TLR-2 functions as a master sentry receptor to detect neuronal death and tissue damage in many different neurological conditions including nerve trans-section injury, traumatic brain injury and hippocampal excitotoxicity (Hayward and Lee, 2014). Astrocytes, the other cellular mediator of neuroinflammation (Ranshoff and Brown, 2012) are also able to sense tissue injury via TLR-3 (Farina et al., 2007; Rossi, 2015).

This is in part due to evolutionary-conserved mechanisms evolved to kill virus-infected cells or tumor cells; in part it is a bystander phenomenon due to the release of mediators that should activate other cells and contribute to the killing of invading micro-organisms. An exaggerated or unbalanced activation of immune cells can thus lead to parenchymal (neuronal) cell death (Gehrmann et al., 1995). Mediators known to have such effects comprise components of the complement system and cytolkines/death receptor ligands triggering programmed cell death (Dong and Benveniste, 2001). Various secreted proteases (e.g. matrix metalloproteases), lipid mediators (e.g. ceramide or gangliosides) or reactive oxygen species can contribute to bystander death of neurons (Chao et al., 1995; Nakajima et al., 2002; Brown and Bal-Price, 2003; Ktaft and Harry, 2011; Taetsch and Block, 2013). The equimolar production of superoxide and NO from glial cells can lead to high steady levels of peoxynitrite, which is a very potent cytotoxicant (Yuste et al., 2015).

Healthy cells continuously display anti &quot;eat-me&quot; signals, while damaged and stressed neurons/neurites display &quot;eat-me&quot; signals that may be recognized by microglia as signals to start phagocytosis (Neher et al., 2012). Reactive astrocytes are also able to release neurotoxic molecules (Mena and Garcia de Ybenes, 2008; Niranjan, 2014). However, astrocytes may also be protective due to their capacity to quench free radicals and secrete neurotrophic factors. The activation of astrocytes may reduce neurotrophic support to neurons (for review, Mena and Garcia de Ybenes, 2008).

	dcterms:description	"""Under physiological conditions, in the developing nervous system, apoptosis occurs during the process of synaptogenesis, where competition leads to the loss of excess neurons and to the connection of the appropriate neurons (Buss et al., 2006; Mennerick and Zorumski, 2000; Oppenheim, 1991). When a stressor increases the number of apoptotic cells this KE has a negative effect on synaptogenesis as the reduced number of neurons (besides the ones that have been already eliminated through the physiological process of apoptosis) provides limited dendritic fields for receiving synaptic inputs from incoming axons. At the same time the loss of neurons also means that there are less axons to establish synaptic contacts (Olney, 2014), leading to reduced synaptogenesis. The ability of a neuron to communicate is based on neural network formation that relies on functional synapse establishment (Col&oacute;n-Ramos, 2009). The main roles of synapses are the regulation of intercellular communication in the nervous system, and the information flow within neural networks. The connectivity and functionality of neural networks depends on where and when synapses are formed. Therefore, the decreased synapse formation due to cell death during the process of synaptogenesis is critical and leads to decrease of neural network formation and function in the adult brain.

Synaptic transmission and plasticity require the integrity of the anatomical substrate. The connectivity of axons emanating from one set of cells to post-synaptic side of synapse on the dendrites of the receiving cells must be intact for effective communication between neurons. Changes in the placement of cells within the network due to delays in neuronal migration, the absence of a full formation of dendritic arbors and spine upon which synaptic contacts are made, and the lagging of transmission of electrical impulses due to insufficient myelination will individually and cumulatively impair synaptic function.

Therefore, chemicals inducing neuronal cell death by apoptosis or necrosis, or interfering with a particular system of neurotransmitters, will alter network structure and function.

	dcterms:description	"""Oxidative stress (OS) as a concept in redox biology and medicine has been formulated in 1985 (Sies, 2015). OS is intimately linked to cellular energy balance and comes from the imbalance between the generation and detoxification of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) or from a decay of the antioxidant protective ability. OS is characterized by the reduced capacity of endogenous systems to fight against the oxidative attack directed towards target biomolecules (Wang and Michaelis, 2010; Pisoschi and Pop, 2015). &nbsp;Glutathione, the most important redox buffer in cells (antioxidant), cycles between reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and serves as a vital sink for control of ROS levels in cells (Reynolds et al., 2007). &nbsp;Several case-control studies have reported the link between lower concentrations of GSH, higher levels of GSSG and the development of diseases (Rossignol and Frye, 2014). OS can cause cellular damage and subsequent cell death because the ROS oxidize vital cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (Gilgun-Sherki, Melamed and Offen, 2001; Wang and Michaelis, 2010).

The central nervous system is especially vulnerable to free radical damage since it has a high oxygen consumption rate, an abundant lipid content and reduced levels of antioxidant enzymes (Coyle and Puttfarcken, 1993; Markesbery, 1997). It has been show that the developing brain is particularly vulnerable to neurotoxicants and OS due to differentiation processes, changes in morphology, lack of physiological barriers and less intrinsic capacity to cope with cellular stress (Grandjean and Landrigan, 2014; Sandstr&ouml;m et al., 2017). OS has been link to brain aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and other related adverse conditions.&nbsp; There is evidence that free radicals play a role in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, head injury, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Down&rsquo;s syndrome, and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease due to cellular damage (Markesbery, 1997; Gilgun-Sherki, Melamed and Offen, 2001; Wang and Michaelis, 2010). OS has also been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases and deficits like autism spectrum disorder and postnatal motor coordination deficits (Wells et al., 2009; Rossignol and Frye, 2014; Bhandari and Kuhad, 2015)

Severe cardiac dysfunction can result in congestive fetal heart failure (inability of the heart to deliver adequate blood flow to organs) leading to fluid build-up in tissues and cavities (edema and effusion, respectively). Fluid buildup exerts a positive pressure on fetal cardiac chambers, which further limits the diastolic ventricular filling reserve, potentiating the diminished cardiac output and leading to fetal death (Thakur et al. 2013).

It remains unclear whether edema plays an essential role in causing fetal death, or whether it simply accelerates the rate of deterioration; nonetheless, it is a reliable indicator of cardiotoxicity.

	dcterms:description	"""Alkylating agents are highly reactive chemicals that may produce cellular damage by covalently binding to cellular macromolecules to form adducts and thereby preventing their proper functioning. Covalent protein alkylation by reactive electrophiles was identified as a key triggering event in chemical toxicity; it disturbs the cellular redox balance - contributing also to the development of oxidative stress - through interaction with glutathione, which leads to disruption of multiple biochemical pathways in exposed cells and is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn, can trigger the death of exposed cells via either apoptosis and/or necrosis. [1][2][3][4][5]
For example, Acrolein, the metabolite of Allyl Alcohol is a highly reactive electrophilic aldehyde and rapidly binds to cellular nucleophiles like glutathione. Thiol redox balance is critical for numerous cell functions Acrolein has been identified as both a product and initiator of lipid peroxidation.
[6]
The high toxic potential of Acrolein reflects its possession of two strongly electrophilic centres which ensure it readily reacts with nucleophilic groups on biological molecules including glutathione and proteins.  These reactions typically proceed via Michael addition of nucleophiles to the a,b-unsaturated bond of Acrolein, generating carbonyl-retaining adducts with the ability to undergo
further crosslinking. Reaction of the carbonyl group in the first instance to form Schiff base adducts is typically much less preferred. Adduction of a diverse range of targets, in addition to disruption of the cellular redox balance, appears to underlie the disruption of multiple biochemical pathways in Acrolein-exposed cells. Such events can trigger the death of exposed cells via either apoptosis and/or necrosis. [7]
It has been suggested that the alkylation of nucleophilic groups of cellular macromolecules effected by Acrolein after glutathione depletion is the event actually leading to cell injury.[8]
Another example for an alkylating agent is Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl4), for which consensus has emerged that its toxicity is a mutifactorial process involving the generation of CCl4-derived free radicals, lipid peroxidation, covalent binding to macromolecules, loss of calcium homeostasis, nucleic acid hypomethylation and inflammatory cytokines. CCl4-derived free radicals are highly reactive species that are able to alkylate proteins and nucleic acids to generate CCl4-derived adducts. [9]

Damaged liver cells trigger a sterile inflammatory response with activation of innate immune cells through release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which activate KCs through toll-like receptors and recruit activated neutrophils and monocytes into the liver.  Central to this inflammatory response is the promotion of ROS formation by these phagocytes.
Upon initiation of apoptosis hepatocytes undergo genomic DNA fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies; these apoptotic bodies are consecutively engulfed by KCs and cause their activation.  
This increased phagocytic activity strongly up-regulates NOX expression in KCs, a superoxide producing enzyme of phagocytes with profibrogenic activity, as well as nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA transcriptional levels with consequent harmful reaction between ROS and nitricoxide (NO), like the generation of cytotoxic peroxinitrite (N2O3).
ROS and/or diffusible aldehydes also derive from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) which are additional initial triggers of KC activation.

Engulfment of apoptotic bodies from hepatocytes results in HSC activation and induces NOX (NADPH oxidases) expression in HSCs. DNA from apoptotic hepatocytes induces toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-dependent changes of HSCs that are consistent with late stages of HSC differentiation (activation), with up-regulation of collagen production and inhibition of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-mediated chemotaxis to retain HSCs at sites of cellular apoptosis.
The release of latent TGF-beta complex into the micro-environment by damaged hepatocytes is likely to be one of the first signals for adjacent HSCs leading to their activation.

Damaged hepatocytes also influence liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSECs), which make an integral part of the hepatic reticulo-endothelial system and have a role in HSC activation. LSECs are morphologically identified by their fenestrations, which are transcytoplasmic canals arranged in sieve plates. In healthy liver, hepatocytes and HSCs maintain this phenotype of LSECs through release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Differentiated (i.e. fenestrated) LSECs prevent HSC activation and promote reversal of activated HSC to quiescence, but LSEC lose this effect when they are de-differentiated due to liver injury. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that LSECs undergo defenestration as an early event that not only precedes liver fibrosis, but may also be permissive for it.  Changes in LSEC differentiation might be an integral part of the development of fibrosis. Furthermore, in fibrosis LSECs become highly pro-inflammatory and secrete an array of cytokines and chemokines 
[11] 
[12] [13] [14] [15]
This relationship is classified as indirect as HSCs activation is partly mediated by TGF-Œ≤1 and LSECs.

In response to TGF-Œ≤1, HSCs activate into myofibroblast-like cells, producing type I, III and IV collagen, proteoglycans like biglycan and decorin, glycoproteins like laminin, fibronectin, tenascin and glycosaminoglycan. [1]   
In the further course of events activated HSCs themselves express TGF-Œ≤1.  TGF-Œ≤1 induces its own mRNA to sustain high levels in local sites of liver injury. The effects of TGF-Œ≤1 are mediated by intracellular signalling via Smad proteins. Smads 2 and 3 are stimulatory whereas Smad 7 is inhibitory. Smad1/5/8, MAP kinase and PI3 kinase are further signalling pathways in different cell types for TGF-Œ≤1 effects. [2]    
Concomitant with increased TGF-Œ≤ production, HSC increase production of collagen. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a profibrogenic peptide induced by TGF-Œ≤, that stimulates the synthesis of collagen type I and fibronectin and may mediate some of the downstream effects of TGF-Œ≤. It is upregulated during activation of HSC, suggesting that its expression is another determinant of a fibrogenic response to TGF-Œ≤  [3]. During fibrogenesis, tissue and blood levels of active TGF-Œ≤ are elevated and overexpression of TGF-Œ≤1 in transgenic mice can induce fibrosis. Additionally, experimental fibrosis can be inhibited by anti-TGF-Œ≤ treatments with neutralizing antibodies or soluble TbRs (TGF-Œ≤ receptors) [4].

	dcterms:description	"""Up-regulation of collagen synthesis following hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is among the most striking molecular responses of HSCs to injury and is mediated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Activated HSCs do not only proliferate and increase cell number, but also increase collagen production per cell. Synthesis of type I collagen is initiated by expression of the col1a1 and col1a2 genes, giving rise to Œ± 1(I) and Œ± 2(I) procollagen mRNAs in a 2:1 ratio. Upon activation of HSCs and other myofibroblast precursors, there is a &gt; 50-fold increase in Œ± 1(I) procollagen mRNA levels. The half-life of collagen Œ±1(I) mRNA increases 20-fold in activated HSCs compared with quiescent HSCs. 
Monocytes and macrophages are involved in inflammatory actions by producing large amounts of Nitric oxide (NO) and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Œ± which have a direct stimulatory effect on HSC collagen synthesis. Synthesis of TGF-Œ± and TGF-Œ≤ promotes activation of neighbouring quiescent HSCs, whereas the release of HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) stimulates regeneration of adjacent hepatocytes.
The basement membrane-like matrix is normally comprised of collagens IV and VI, which is progressively replaced by collagens I and III and cellular fibronectin during fibrogenesis. Although multiple extracellular matrix (ECM) components are up-regulated, type I collagen is the most abundant protein.  
These changes in ECM composition initiate several positive feedback pathways that further amplify collagen production. Increasing matrix stiffness is a stimulus for HSC activation and matrix-provoked signals link to other growth factor receptors through integrin-linked kinase and transduce via membrane-bound guanosine triphosphate binding proteins, in particular Rho67 and Rac, signals to the actin cytoskeleton that promote migration and contraction.  
The overall amount of collagen deposited by fibroblasts is a regulated balance between collagen synthesis and collagen catabolism. Down-regulated expression of degrading Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and up-regulation of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), MMP- inhibitors, lead to a net decrease in protease activity, and therefore, matrix accumulation.
Chronic inflammation, hypoxia and oxidative stress reactivate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) developmental programmes that converge in the activation of NF-kB. Cells that may transdifferentiate into fibrogenic myofibroblasts are hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Additional sources of ECM include bone marrow (which probably gives rise to circulating fibrocytes) and portal fibroblasts.

Deposition of collagen in the liver progressively disrupts the normal hepatic architecture so that the normal relationship between vascular inflow and outflow is destroyed and the normal collagen content around hepatic sinusoids in regenerating nodules becomes modified.Advanced liver fibrosis results in cirrhosis.

T-cells are typically affected by protein-hapten complexes presented by dendritic cells on MHC molecules. Molecular understanding of this process has improved in recent years ([3]). Briefly, MHC molecules are membrane proteins which present the small peptide antigens placed in a ‚Äúgroove‚Äù of the MHC molecule during its intracellular synthesis and transport to the cell surface. In the context of the MHC molecular on the cell surface, the small peptide antigen is recognized via the T-cell receptors as self or non-self (e.g. foreign). If this peptide is a foreign peptide, such as part of a protein-hapten complex, the T-cell will be activated to form a memory T-cell, which subsequently proliferates ([4]).
These observations are consistent with the immunological mechanism presented with this AOP, where it is assumed that for an adverse outcome to commence, a certain number of dendritic cells is required to be activated and to migrate to the nearest lymph node in order to instigate the further cascade of biological events (see[5]).

Activation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-18 results from cleavage of inactive IL-18 precursor protein by inflammasome-associated caspase-1[1]. Hapten-protein complexes can activate the inflammasome ([2];[3]) and in so doing induce IL-18 production. Intracellular Nod-like receptors (NLR) contain sensors for a number of cellular insults. Upon activation (by a currently unknown mechanism), NLRs oligomerise form molecular complexes (i.e. inflammasomes) that are involved in the activation of inflammatory-associated caspases, including caspase-1.
Keratinocyte exposure to hapten-protein complex also results in induction of antioxidant/electrophile response element ARE/EpRE-dependent pathways[4]. Briefly, reactive chemicals bind to Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associates protein 1) that normally inhibits the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Released Nrf2 interacts with other nuclear proteins and binds to and activates ARE/EpREdependent pathways, including the cytoprotective genes NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferase (GSHST), among others ([4];[5]).

Transfer of free T4 (and to a lesser extent, T3) from serum binding proteins (thyroid binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (TTR) and albumin; see McLean et al., 2017, for a recent review) into the brain requires transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB) and /or indirect transport from the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) into the brain through the blood-CSF-barrier.&nbsp; The blood vessels in rodents and humans expresses the main T4 transporter, MCT8, (Roberts et al. 2008), as does the choroid plexus which also expresses TTR and secretes the protein into the CSF (Alshehri et al. 2015).

T4 entering the brain through the BBB is taken up into astrocytes via cell membrane iodothyronine transporters (e.g., organic anion-transporting polypeptides) (Visser et al., 2011). &nbsp;In astrocytes, T4 is then deiodinated by Type II deiodinase to triiodothyronine (T3) (St Germain and Galton, 1997), which is then transported via other iodothyronine transporters (e.g., monocarboxylate transporter) into neurons (Visser et al., 2011). While some circulating T3 may be taken up into brain tissue directly from blood (Dratman et al., 1991), the majority of neuronal T3 comes from deiodination of T4 in astrocytes. Decreases in circulating T4 will result in decreased brain T3 tissue concentrations. It is also known that Type II deiodinase can be up-regulated in response to decreased T4 concentrations to maintain tissue concentrations of T3 (Pedraza et al., 2007; Lavado-Autric et al., 2013; Morse et al., 1986), except in tanycytes of the paraventricular nucleus (Fekete and Lechan, 2014).

The neuronal spine is the primary site of action for synaptic interface between neurons. Although difficult to measure due to their small size, large number and variable shapes, changes in the frequency and structure of dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons has dramatic effects on synaptic physiology and plasticity (Harris et al., 1992). Anatomical integrity at a more macro-level is also essential for physiological function. The connectivity of axons emanating from one set of cells that synapse on the dendrites of the receiving cells must be intact for effective communication between neurons to be possible. Synaptogenesis is a critical step for neurons to be integrated into neural networks during development. Changes in the placement of cells within the network due to delays or alterations in neuronal migration, the absence of a full proliferation of dendritic arbors and spine upon which synaptic contacts are made, and the lagging of transmission of electrical impulses due to insufficient myelination will independently and cumulatively impair synaptic function.

Angiogenic sprouting is a complex molecular process [Herbert and Stanier 2011]. An early step is tip cell selection. Endothelial cells are normally suppressed in their tip cell behaviors due to lateral inhibition by Notch-Delta. Lateral inhibition is broken when VEGFR2 is activated by VEGF-A by an uncertain mechanism. Next, EC tip cells extend filopodial processes and migrate along VEGF-A corridors. Their branching to a tree-like network is patterned by the EphrinB2&ndash;EPHB4 cell adhesion system. Proliferating EC stalk cells meanwhile follow the pioneering sprout.

	dcterms:description	"""The NMDA receptor is distinct from the other glutamate receptors in two ways: first, it is both ligand-gated and voltage-dependent; second, it requires co-activation by two ligands: glutamate and either glycine or D-serine. Following membrane depolarization, the co-agonists, L-glutamate and glycine must bind to their respective sites on the receptor to open the channel. On activation, the NMDA receptor allows the influx of extracellular calcium ions into the postsynaptic neuron and neurotransmission occurs (reviewed in Higley and Sabatini, 2012). Calcium flux through NMDA receptors is also thought to be critical in synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism for learning and memory.
Indeed, NMDA receptor‚Äìdependent synaptic potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) are two forms of activity-dependent long-term changes in synaptic efficacy that are believed to represent cellular correlates of learning and memory processes. The best characterized form of NMDA receptor-dependent LTP and LTD occurs between CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus (Luscher and Malenka, 2012). It is now well established that modest activation of NMDARs leads to modest increases in postsynaptic calcium, triggering LTD, whereas much stronger activation of NMDARs leading to much larger increases in postsynaptic calcium are required to trigger LTP (Luscher and  Malenka, 2012). The high-frequency stimulation causes a strong temporal summation of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials, and depolarization of the postsynaptic cell is sufficient to relieve the Mg2+ block of the NMDAR and allow a large amount of calcium to enter into the post-synaptic cells.

	dcterms:description	"""It is well established in the existing literature that NMDA receptor‚Äìdependent synaptic potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) are two forms of activity directly linked to long-term changes in synaptic efficacy and plasticity,  the fundamental processes underlying learning and memory. The best characterized form of LTP occurs in the CA3-CA1 region of the hippocampus, in which LTP is initiated by transient activation of NMDARs that leads to a persistent increase in synaptic transmission through AMPA receptors (Benke et al., 1998) that can be achieved either through increasing the number of AMPA receptors at the post-synaptic surface or by increasing the single channel conductance of the receptors expressed. It has been shown that LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus could be accounted for by these two mechanisms (Benke et al 1998). 
The degree of activity of NMDARs is determined in part by extracellular Mg(2+) and by the co-agonists for this receptor, glycine and D-serine. During strong stimulation, a relief of the voltage-dependent block of NMDARs by Mg(2+) provides a positive feedback for NMDAR Ca(2+) influx into postsynaptic CA1 spines. The induction of LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses requires further signal amplification of NMDAR activity. Src family kinases (SFKs) play a "core" role in the induction of LTP by enhancing the function and expression of NMDARs. At CA3-CA1 synapses, NMDARs are largely composed of NR1 (NMDA receptor subunit 1)-NR2A or NR1-NR2B containing subunits. Recent, but controversial, evidence has correlated NR1-NR2A receptors with the induction of LTP and NR1-NR2B receptors with LTD. However, LTP can be induced by activation of either subtype of NMDAR and the ratio of NR2A:NR2B receptors has been proposed as an alternative determinant of the direction of synaptic plasticity. Many transmitters and signal pathways can modify NMDAR function and expression and, for a given stimulus strength, they can potentially lead to a change in the balance between LTP and LTD (MacDonald et al., 2006). 
Mammalian learning and memory is one of the outcomes of the functional expression of neurons connected into neural networks. Neuronal damage or cell death induced by chemical compounds  disrupts integration and transmission of information through neural networks thereby setting the stage for subsequent impairment of learning and memory. Exposure to chemicals that will increase the risk of functional neuronal network damage lead to learning and memory impairment.

	dcterms:description	"""Thyroid hormones (THs), thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are synthesized in the thyroid gland in the presence of functional NIS and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) as iodinated thyroglobulin (Tg), and stored in the colloid of thyroid follicles. NIS is a membrane bound glycoprotein whose main physiological function is to transport one iodide ion along with two sodium ions across the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells. Extensive studies on NIS protein have identified 14 different mutations and each one of them is related to Iodine Transport Deficiencies (ITD) (Spitzweg and Morris, 2010). Once inside the follicular cells, the iodide diffuses to the apical membrane, where it is metabolically oxidized through the action of TPO to iodinium (I+), which in turn iodinates tyrosine residues of the Tg proteins in the follicle colloid. Therefore, NIS is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). TPO is a heme-containing apical membrane protein within the follicular lumen of thyrocytes that acts as the enzymatic catalyst for TH synthesis (Taurog, 2005). Propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole (MMI), are thioureylene drugs that are known to inhibit the ability of TPO to: a) activate iodine and transfer it to thyroglobulin (Tg) (Davidson et al., 1978) and, b) couple thyroglobulin (Tg)-bound iodotyrosyls to produce Tg-bound T3 and T4 (Taurog, 2005). PTU and MMI have been found to decrease also the expression of NIS mRNA and consequently iodide accumulation, as shown in FRTL-5 cells (Spitzweg et al. 1999).

Other compounds, such as triclosan, triclocarban, 2,2&#39;,4,4&#39;-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), and bisphenol A (BPA) have been reported to decrease thyroid hormone (TH) levels by inducing an inhibition of NIS-mediated iodide uptake and altering the expression of genes involved in TH synthesis in rat thyroid follicular FRTL-5 cells, and on the activity of thyroid peroxidase (TPO), using rat thyroid microsomes (Wu Y et al. 2016).

Perchlorate, thiocyanate, nitrate, and iodide, which are competitive inhibitors of iodide uptake, have been shown to inhibit radioactive iodide uptake by NIS (Tonacchera et al. 2004), consequentially resulting in inhibition of TH synthesis. In particular, perchlorate blocks iodide uptake into the thyroid through NIS inhibition and decreases the production of TH (Steinmaus, 2016a). More recent evidence also suggests that young children, pregnant women, foetuses, and people co-exposed to similarly acting agents may be especially susceptible to perchlorate-induced toxicity (Steinmaus et al., 2016b).

Concern about environmental perchlorate exposure is focused on its inhibition of iodide uptake into the thyroid (MIE). Decreased iodine intake may decrease thyroid hormone production. Perchlorate exposure, therefore, might be particularly detrimental in iodine-deficient individuals. Median urinary iodine levels are used instead and reflect dietary iodine sufficiency across populations (International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD); available from: www.iccidd.org). According to ICCIDD report Iodine deficiency continues to be an important global public health issue, with an estimated 2.2 million people (38% of the world&#39;s population) living in iodine-deficient areas. In 1990, the United Nations World Summit for Children set forth the goal of eliminating iodine deficiency worldwide (UNICEF World Summit for Children. Available from: http://www.unicef.org/wsc/declare.htm; 1990). &nbsp;Considerable progress has been achieved by programmes of universal salt iodisation (USI) in various countries, in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, UNICEF, ICCIDD. A guide for programme managers. World Health Organization; Geneva: 2007. Assessment of the iodine deficiency disorders and monitoring their elimination.WHO/NHD/01.1). However, many countries remain iodine deficient (de Benoist et al., 2013; Lazarus and Delange, 2004). In the U.S., data from large population studies have shown that median urinary iodine levels decreased by approximately 50% between the early 1970s and the early 1990s, although the population overall remained iodine sufficient (Hollowell et al., 1998). Subsequent studies have shown that this decrease has stabilised (Caldwell et al., 2005). The WHO still considers iodine deficiency, which leads to hypothyroidism, the single most important preventable cause of brain damage worldwide (WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD, 2007). The most vulnerable groups are pregnant and lactating women and their developing fetuses and neonates, given the crucial importance of iodine to ensure adequate levels of thyroid hormones for brain maturation. Iodine deficiency in pregnancy is a prevailing problem not only in developing countries, but also in western industrialized nations and other countries classified as free of iodine deficiency, and solution may be found in dietary changes (Moog et al., 2017).

	dcterms:description	"""It is widely accepted that the thyroid hormones (TH) have a prominent role in the development and function of the Central Nervous System (CNS) and their action has been closely linked to the cognitive function because of their importance in the neocortical development (Gilbert et al., 2012). During the early cortical network development TH has been shown to influence the number of cholinergic neurons and the degree of innervation of hippocampal CA3 and CA1 regions (Oh et al., 1991; Thompson and Potter 2000), and to regulate the morphology and function of GABAergic neurons (Westerholz et al., 2010).

One of the mediators of this regulation has been suggested to be the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), whose role in brain development and function has been very well-documented (Binder and Scharfman, 2004) and which function has been associated with TH levels in the brain (Gilbert and Lasley, 2013). Several studies have shown that TH can regulate BDNF expression in the brain (Koibuchi et al., 1999; Koibuchi and Chin, 2000; Sui and Li, 2010), with the subsequent neurodevelopmental consequences.

In view of the above evidence, it has been shown that the thyroid insufficiency (lower TH levels) results in reduction of BDNF levels (mRNA or protein) in the developmental brain.

	dcterms:description	"""GABAergic interneurons are remarkably diverse and complex in nature and they are believed to play a key role in numerous neurodevelopmental processes (Southwell et al., 2014). Among them, those that express parvalbumin (PV) (marker of GABAergic interneurons) as their calcium-binding protein are the ones subjected to regulations by neurotrophins and BDNF specifically (Woo and Lu, 2006). These neurons do not express the BDNF protein but its functional receptor, Trk-B (Cellerino et al., 1996; Marty et al., 1996; Gorba and Wahle, 1999). BDNF is released by the BDNF-producing neurons of the CNS and binds to Trk-B of the GABA PV-interneurons, an interaction necessary for the subsequent developmental effects mediated by BDNF (Polleux et al., 2002; Jin et al., 2003; Rico et al., 2002; Aguado et al., 2003). BDNF promotes the morphological and neurochemical maturation of hippocampal and neocortical interneurons and promotes GABAergic synaptogenesis (Danglot et al., 2006 and Hu and Russek, 2008). BDNF also regulates the expression of the GABA-specific K(+)/Cl(-) co-transporter, KCC2, which is responsible for switching of GABA action from excitatory to inhibitory, and consequently determines the nature of GABA-induced development of glutamatergic (excitatory) synapses (Wang and Kriegstein, 2009; Blaesse et al., 2009).

	dcterms:description	"""Early in cortical development, the GABAergic interneurons have been found to contribute to key aspects of the brain development. A precise balance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses in cortical neurons is crucial for the formation and maturation of the neuronal connections and eventually the proper neural circuitry function. In the cerebral cortex, the young neurons first receive GABAergic depolarizing inputs before forming any synapses (Owens et al., 1999; Tyzio et al., 1999; Hennou et al., 2002), and thus the GABAergic system is believed to be the initial regulator of synaptogenesis.&nbsp; Indeed, initial depolarizing GABAergic transmission is required for the formation of the glutamatergic synapses and is therefore responsible for the regulation of the balance between excitation and inhibition in the developing cortex (Wang and Kriegstein, 2009; Owens et al., 1999; Tyzio et al., 1999; Hennou et al., 2002; Ben-Ari, 2006). Nascent GABAergic synapses contain both presynaptic and postsynaptic elements, and produce synaptic transmission (Ahmari and Smith, 2002). GABAA receptors form clusters before presynaptic terminals emerge (Scotti and Reuter, 2001), and this clustering occur in the absence of scaffolding proteins and GABA release (Scotti and Reuter, 2001; Christie et al., 2002). Also, during maturation, GABAA receptors become selectively clustered across from terminals that release the neurotransmitter GABA (Craig et al., 1994; Swanwick et al., 2006).

Brain concentrations of T4 are dependent on transfer of T4 from serum, through the vascular endothelia, into astrocytes.&nbsp; In astrocytes, T4 is converted to T3 by deiodinase and subsequently transferred to neurons cellular membrane transporters. In the brain T3 controls transcription and translation of genes responsible for normal hippocampal structural and functional development. Normal hippocampal structure and physiology are critical for the development of cognitive function. Thus, there is an indisputable indirect link between TH synthesis, controlling the levels of T4 in serum, and cognitive function, including learning and memory processes.

	dcterms:description	"""Disruption of BDNF signaling (and other factors, such as NGF or Reelin, etc.) during brain development was shown to interfere with synaptogenesis in the hippocampus (Sanchez-Martin et al., 2013; Neal et al., 2010; Stansfiled et al., 2012). In the adult brain, BDNF is involved in synaptic plasticity (Lu et al., 2013; Leal et al., 2014), which is a fundamental process linked with learning and memory. Synaptic dysfunction is a key pathophysiological hallmark in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and synaptic repair therapies based on the use of trophic factors, such as BDNF, are currently under consideration (Lu et al., 2013).

BDNF is released by the BDNF-producing neurons of the CNS and binds to Trk-B of the PV-interneurons, an interaction necessary for the subsequent developmental effects of this neurotrophin (Polleux et al., 2002; Jin et al., 2003; Rico et al., 2002; Aguado et al., 2003). BDNF promotes the morphological and neurochemical maturation of hippocampal and neocortical interneurons and promotes GABAergic synaptogenesis (Danglot et al., 2006; Hu and Russek, 2008).

BDNF plays an important role in axonal and dendritic differentiation during embryonic stages of neuronal development, as well as in the formation and maturation of dendritic spines during postnatal development (Chapleau et al., 2009). Recent studies have also implicated vesicular trafficking of BDNF via secretory vesicles, and both secretory and endosomal trafficking of vesicles containing synaptic proteins, such as neurotransmitter and neurotrophin receptors, in the regulation of axonal and dendritic differentiation, and in dendritic spine morphogenesis. Abnormalities in dendritic and synaptic structure are consistently observed in human neurodevelopmental disorders associated with mental retardation, as well as in mouse models of these disorders (Chapleau et al., 2009).

They play a crucial role in the development, maintenance and functioning of the CNS (Huang and Reichardt, 2003; Shafiee et al., 2016). BDNF is known to be directly regulated by thyroid hormones and plays essential roles during the critical period of fetal brain development (Wang et al., 2006), including cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, synaptogenesis and neuronal network formation. In addition, neuronal activity regulates BDNF transcription, transport of BDNF mRNA and protein into dendrites and the activity-dependent secretion of BDNF, which, in turn, modulate synaptic plasticity, synaptogenesis and memory formation (Bekinschtein et al., 2008).

Developmental thyroid hormone insufficiency is associated with reduced cognitive functions and lowered BDNF levels, as shown in both humans and animal models (Chakraborty et al., 2012). For instance, in rats, maternal thyroidectomy significantly reduces BDNF expression in the brain of developing pups (Liu et al., 2010), leading to learning and memory deficits. Prenatal exposure to PTU also leads to reduced hippocampal BDNF in neonatal rats (Chakraborty et al., 2012). This evidence supports the link between decrease of BDNF and learning and memory impairment described in this indirect KER.

	dcterms:description	"""Synaptic transmission and plasticity require the integrity of the anatomical substrate. The connectivity of axons emanating from one set of cells to synapse on the dendrties of the receiving cells must be intact for effective communication between neurons to be possible. Changes in the placement of cells within the network due to delays in neuronal migration, the absence of a full proliferation of dendritic arbors and spine upon which synaptic contacts are made, and the lagging of transmission of electrical impulses due to insufficient myelination will individually and cumulatively impair synaptic function. These anatomical alterations are among a host of many structural anomolies reported in various regions of the brain following severe developmental hypothyroidism. Although the primary evidence of synaptic transmission impairments in hypothyroid models have been limited to hippocampus, it is assumed that the role TH play in these processes is likely similar across different brain regions.

	dcterms:description	"""Cognitive function and impairments thereof are measured using behavioral techniques. It is well accepted that these alterations in behavior are the result of structural or functional changes in neurocircuitry. Functional impairments are often measured using field potentials of critical synaptic circuits in hippocampus and cortex. A number of studies have been performed in rodent models that reveal deficits in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus as a result of developmental thyroid insufficiency. 
A well established model of memory at the synaptic levels is known as long-term potentiation (LTP). Deficiencies in LTP are generally regarded as potential substrates of learning and memory impairments.

Figure 1. The molecular mechanism of activation of gene expression by Aryl hydrocarbon receptor 1 (AHR1).



&nbsp;

The molecular mechanism for AHR-mediated activation of gene expression is presented in Figure 1. In its unliganded form, the AHR is part of a cytosolic complex containing heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), the HSP90 co-chaperone p23 and AHR-interacting protein (AIP)[1]. Upon ligand binding, the AHR migrates to the nucleus where it dissociates from the cytosolic complex and forms a heterodimer with Ahr nuclear translocator (ARNT)[2]. The AHR-ARNT complex then binds to a xenobiotic response element (XRE) found in the promoter of an AHR-regulated gene and recruits co-regulators such as CREB binding protein/p300, steroid receptor co-activator (SRC) 1, SRC-2, SRC-3 and nuclear receptor interacting protein 1, leading to induction of gene expression[1].

	dcterms:description	"""One of the oxidation products of uroporphyrinogen is believed to be a competitive inhibitor of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD). This inhibitor binds to the active site of UROD preventing the normal synthesis of heme, allowing uroporphyrinogen oxidation to dominate and increasing accumulation of hepatic porphyrins[1]. The formation of this inhibitor is increased by iron, a well-known oxidant, by activity of cytochrome P-4501A2, by alcohol excess and by estrogen therapy[2].

Phillips et al.[1] identified this inhibitor as being uroporphomethene using a murine model for porphyria; however, their interpretation of the mass spectroscopy results has been criticized as inaccurate[8], leaving the exact characterization of the UROD inhibitor unresolved.&nbsp;

A negative-feedback loop exists in which the end-product (heme) represses the enzyme ALA synthase 1 and prevents excess formation of heme. When UROD activity is low, the regulatory heme pool is potentially depleted, causing a repression of the negative feedback loop, thereby increasing levels of precursors and furthering the accumulation of porphyrins.

The ability of porphyrins to absorb light of 400&ndash;410 nm (the Soret band) is the key factor in producing the photocutaneous lesions observed on sun exposed areas in affected individuals. The porphyrins absorb this light and enter a high energy state, which is then transferred to molecular oxygen resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS cause phototoxic damage and further catalyze the oxidation of porphyrinogens to porphyrins. Some porphyrins, mainly uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyl porphyrin, form needle-shaped crystals resulting in hydrophilic cytoplasmic inclusions[1]. Porphyrins demonstrate a range of water solubilities, and therefore show unique tissue and cellular distributions, resulting in different patterns of phototoxic damage histologically and cytologically[2].

Violet light excites the delocalized electrons in porphyrins. If the energy is not given out as red fluorescent light, it is passed onto oxygen to form tissue damaging free radicals. (Source: Sarkany, R. P. (2008).Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 24(2), 102-108.)

NAD(P)H plays a central role in the redox state of the mitochondrion: NADP is reduced, in part, by the activity of the NADH/NADP transhydrogenase that functions as a proton pump [1] and has a reductive effect on glutathione and thioredoxin. This directly links mitochondrial coupling and the membrane potential to the redox potential. As a consequence, an imbalance in the NAD(P) redox status can lead to mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), a nonselective permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane [4]. An imbalance of the redox state of these pyridine nucleotides and thus condition of oxidative stress can lead to an increased influx of Ca2+, which in turn facilitates activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, leading to apoptosis [5] [6].

	dcterms:description	"""Apoptosis is a complex process that regulates whether cell death leads to the induction of inflammation or quiet removal of a damaged cell, for example during development or normal tissue turnover. This most likely depends on the severity of the effect[1]. Additional cell death mechanisms are known to be potent inducers of inflammation, such as necrosis (including secondary necrosis which can follow apoptosis if the removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytic cells fails). Necrosis leads to the release of intracellular contents into the extracellular milieu, thus inducing an inflammatory response[2]. 
The induction of inflammation by apoptosis is usually linked to infiltration of neutrophils, which are recruited by secreted CXC chemokines. Dying hepatocytes can release intracellular molecules known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which, if persistent, can induce the so-called sterile inflammation. This occurs in the absence of pathogens and is a key factor for the development of (liver) inflammation [3][4]. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondria-derived formyl peptides are examples of mitochondria-derived DAMPs which bind to pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) such as toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are found expressed in most liver cells, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells (KCs) or hepatic stellate cells (HPCs) [3]. Specifically, mtDNA-activated TLR9 has recently been described to play a role in the development of liver inflammation and accompanied induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) [5]. 
Fas is a cell surface glycoprotein that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. It is known that ligation of the Fas receptor promotes the proteolytic cleavage of intracellular caspases and thus leads to the induction of apoptosis[6]. Activation of Fas directly leads to the activation of caspase-3 and induction of a variety of cytokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2)/IL-8, KC, IL-6, MCP-1/CCL2 and sICAM-1. However, when caspase-3 was inhibited, the chemokine-induction was significantly reduced. Faouzi and coworkers could also show that the transcription factor AP-1, and not NF-kB, was involved in the onset of apoptosis-induced liver inflammation[6][7].

Many iron containing metallo-proteins are degraded within the lysosomes, leading to an enrichment of this transition metal within this organelle. Iron which is released inside lysosomes due to degradation processes is transported to the cytoplasm and then stored in ferritin, a ubiquitous and highly conserved iron-binding protein [2]. Induction of lysosomal membrane disruption by lysosomotropic detergents has been found to cause an induction of ferritin, together with an increase of cellular ROS and concomitant reduction of the antioxidants MnSOD (manganese superoxide dismutase) and GSH (glutathione). A suggested explanation for this is the release of free iron into the cytosol [2].

	dcterms:description	"""Lysosomes were first described by de Duve and colleagues in 1955 [1]. They are acidic, single-membrane bound organelles that are present in all eukaryotic cells and are filled with more than 50 acid hydrolases to serve their purpose of degrading macromolecules [2]. Amongst these are cathepsins that are released into the cytosol once lysosomal membrane permeabilisation (LMP) occurs. 
The major substrate of cathepsins are Bid, Bcl-2 and Bax. This initiates the subsequent activation of caspase-9 and 3/7, leading to mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation (MMP) and mitochondria-induced apoptosis [3]. The role of cathepsins, especially cathepsin D on mitochondria has been studied in detail: microinjection of cathepsin D into the cytosol induced a subsequent release of cytochrome c, caspase activation and induction of apoptosis. This could be prevented by using inactivated cathepsin D or the cathepsin D inhibitor pepstatin A [4]. The use of this inhibitor and its effect on preventing cytochrome c release or caspase-3 activation, together with an inhibition of apoptosis, has also been reported previously [5].
Moreover, translocation of tBid was observed following LMP induced by Au-ZnO hybrid nanoparticles, which was accompanied by a time-dependent release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase 3 [6]. 
Another study applied high content imaging to show the occurrence of LMP and MMP at different concentrations in a variety of different cell lines. When determining the IC50/EC50 value, by using positively charged polystyrene particles (PS-NH2) it could be shown that lysosomal damage appeared at lower concentrations than mitochondrial damage in all cells [7].
The importance of MMP in LMP-induced cell death was furthermore confirmed by work of Boya and colleagues: by using the quinolone antibiotics ciprofloxacin (CPX) or norfloxacin (NFX) (with or without UV light) which are known inducers of LMP, treatment of cells resulted in caspase-independent cell death, with hallmarks of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation and phosphatidylserine exposure on the plasma membrane. However, inhibition of the lysosomal accumulation of CPX or NFX suppressed their capacity to induce LMP and to kill cells. Moreover, using Bax/Bak double deficient cells, MMP and subsequent cell death were completely abolished, showing that mitochondria are indispensable for cell death initiated by lysosomal destabilization [8].

This leads to an upregulation of chemokines and inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±), interleukins or proteases [1][2]. TLRs are found expressed in most cells, including liver cells such as hepatocytes, Kupffer cells (KCs) or hepatic stellate cells (HPCs) [2]. 
Upon cytokine secretion, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) that, amongst others, circulate in the blood, can become attracted. PMNs are potent phagocytes, but they also lead to pathogen destruction upon oxidative bursting and are for their part capable of pro-inflammatory cytokine production as well. Various endothelial adhesion molecules, such as the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), mediate neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells. ICAM-1 expression on the luminal surface of the capillary is increased during inflammation, and interacts with √ü2 integrin, which is expressed on the surface of PMN. Subsequent to adhesion, neutrophils begin to migrate across the endothelium and towards the center of inflammation [3][4]. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is known to be one of the most potent chemoattractants for the recruitment and activation of neutrophils into various organs (e.g. lung, intestine), and binds to the human CXC chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) and CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) on the surface of the PMN [5][6][7]. But not only IL-8, also macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), growth-regulated oncogenes-Œ±, -Œ≤, and -Œ≥, as well as the rodent peptides cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant and KC are all members of the CXC subfamily of chemokines and chemoattractants for inflammatory cells[8]
Cullen and co-workers could further confirm the importance of specific chemokines for chemotaxis of different inflammatory cells. They depleted certain chemokines by using respective antibodies in supernatants of Fas-stimulated HeLa cells (see Relationship:924 for explanation on Fas and its role on cytokine induction) and subsequently assessed the chemotactic activity of immune cells. Only depletion of MCP-1 was sufficient to block almost all THP-1 monocyte chemotaxis. On the other hand, chemotaxis of primary human peripheral blood neutrophils was depending mainly on secreted IL-8. Using an in vivo mouse model, the authors found that Fas stimulation could trigger phagocyte migration by administration of anti-Fas (Jo2) antibody into C57BL/6 mice within 10 h of anti-Fas administration. This correlated with extensive cell death in the thymus and a dramatic increase of CD11b-positive macrophages in the same tissue[9].

	dcterms:description	"""Immune cells such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) or monocytes, circulate in the blood and become attracted towards a gradient of secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines. PMNs have a life span of only 7-12 hours. Therefore, around 1-2 x 1011 PMN are produced daily in the human body. They account for about 50-70&#160;% of all blood leukocytes in the human body [1][2]. Upon an inflammatory event, neutrophil production is upregulated, and its lifetime increases as a response to platelet activating factor (PAF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or various pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1√ü (IL-1√ü) [2]. 
In sterile tissue injury, for example as the result of apoptosis, there is no need for PMNs to function as antimicrobial effectors; instead, they clear debris and initiate the wound-healing process. Released damage-associated molecular patterns (see Relationship:924) stimulate Kupffer cells to produce IL-1√ü which leads to intercellular adhesion molecular-1 (ICAM-1) upregulation on sinusoidal endothelial cells [3]. ICAM-1 in turn mediates neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, as it interacts with √ü2 integrin, which is expressed on the surface of PMNs. Subsequent to adhesion, neutrophils begin to migrate across the endothelium and towards the affected tissue [4][5]. The transition of neutrophils from a resting state, as during circulation in the blood, to an activated state at the site of infection is triggered by an ordered sequence of signals from cytokines[3].
The aberrant activation of neutrophils and their extended lifespan upon an inflammatory stimulus can increase the probability of extracellular damage. PMNs are potent phagocytes, but they also lead to pathogen destruction upon oxidative bursting. The oxidative burst is marked by an increased consumption of molecular oxygen, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2 and OH‚Ä¢, and reactive nitrogen species (RNS)[6].
In general, the acute inflammatory response, as in the liver, is bi-phasic. The initial phase is characterised by a macrophage (Kupffer cell)-mediated phase, with the generation of reactive oxygen species aggravating the organ damage. The activated macrophages and subsequent infiltrating lymphocytes produce additional cytokines that further promote the inflammatory response, leading to a second phase, during which neutrophils become fully activated and secrete ROS, complement components, proteases, CXCL-1 and CXCL-2[3]. The role of IL-1 and IL-17A in neutrophil activation and subsequent induction of inflammation has been confirmed by the use of knock-down models, showing that the absence of these mediators prevent neutrophil infiltration and subsequent onset of inflammation, inhibition of the latter also being shown by direct depletion of neutrophils[7].

	dcterms:description	"""The phosphatase activity of calcineurin (CN) is known to be inhibited by CN inhibitors (CNIs) such as FK506 and cyclosporin A (CsA) through the formation of complexes with immunophilins.

Immunophilins of FK506-binding protein (FKBP) and cyclophilin bind with CNIs FK506 and CsA to form complexes, which inhibit CN activity (Barik. 2006).

While FKBP12, FKBP12.6, FKBP13, and FKBP52 are all part of the FK506-binding FKBP family, FKBP12 has a significant involvement in the mechanism of action for FK506-induced immunosuppression (Siekierka et al. 1989, Kang et al. 2008).

FKBP12 is a 12-kDa protein localized in cytoplasm and has been isolated from Jurkat T-cells as a receptor that binds with the FK506 (Bram et al. 1993). FKBP12 has an FK506-binding domain (FKBD) that comprises 108 amino acids, and is expressed in T cells, B cells, Langerhans cells, and mast cells (Siekierka et al. 1990, Panhans-Gross et al. 2001, Hultsch et al. 1991).

Cyclophilin and FKBP both exhibit peptidyl propyl isomerase (PPIase) activity, but the PPlase activity and the inhibition of activity that they indicate are unrelated to CN regulation.

CN is a heterodimer that comprises a catalytic subunit (CnA) and a Ca-binding regulatory subunit (CnB). CnA handles phosphatase activity as well as calmodulin binding, and CnB regulates intracellular calcium and CnA (Klee et al. 1988, Zhang et al. 1996). CnA is a 59kDa protein with a serine-threonine phosphatase domain.

CNI-immunophilin complexes such as FK506/FKBP complexes and cyclophilin/CsA complexes bind directly to CnA in the cell, causing steric hindrance of substrate binding to CN, which in turn&nbsp;inhibits phosphatase activity of CN (Schreiber and Crabtree 1992, Liu et al. 1993, Bierer et al. 1993, Bram et al. 1993, Rao et al. 1997, Liu et al. 1991).

The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is a substrate of CN (Rao et al. 1997).

When T-cell activation takes place, T-cell&ndash;receptor-mediated stimulus increases the intracellular concentration of calcium and activates CnB, which subsequently induces CnA phosphatase activation, leading to dephosphorylation of NFAT. In that process, . dephosphorylated SP motifs exposes nuclear localization signal (NLS) and covers nuclear export signal (NES), thereby promoting nuclear localization of NFAT (Matsuda and Koyasu 2000, Zhu and McKeon 1999).

When CN activity is inhibited by the binding of immunophilin complexes, dephosphorylation does not occur in NFAT, thereby interfering with nuclear localization.

(Matsuda and Koyasu 2000, Zhu and McKeon 1999).

Nuclear localization of NFAT results in the NFAT binding with AP 1 at the IL-2 promoter region, (Schreiber and Crabtree 1992; Jain et al. 1992) and induces transcription of IL-2 (Jain et al. 1993). In addition to IL-2, NFAT localized in the nucleus of T cells also binds to the promoter region of the other classes of cytokines including IL-4 and IL-13.

Once CN phosphatase activity is inhibited, dephosphorylation of NFAT and subsequent nuclear localization of NFAT decreases, which results in a decrease of NFAT/AP-1 complex formation at the cytokine promoter sites (Rao et al. 1997).

Decreased formation of NFAT/AP-1 complex at the promoter region of IL-2 genes in the nucleus of T cells following lowed nuclear localization of NFAT by CNI treatment reduces the transcription of IL-2 (Dumont et al. 1998).

Therefore, suppressed production of IL-2 and IL-4 impairs T cell dependent antibody production (Alberts et al. 2008).

T cells, B cells, and antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells are involved in inducing and developing of TDAR. Thus, changes in any of these immune cell populations can influence TDAR

Therefore, FK506 and cyclosporin A (CsA) are potent inhibitors of T-cell&ndash;dependent-antibody production and suppressing the production of these B-cell-related cytokines appears to be the main factor in impairment of TDAR by FK506 (Heidt, S. et al. 2009).

Several fish families have Weberian ossicles (tiny bones, also called the Weberian apparatus), connecting the anterior chamber to the inner ear resulting in an amplification of sound waves. Therefore it is plausible to assume that if the anterior chamber does not inflate or inflates to a reduced size, the connection to the Weberian ossicles is lost and hearing is impaired.

	dcterms:description	"""Reduced T4 levels in serum prohibit local production of active T3 hormone by deiodinases expressed in the target tissues. There is evidence suggesting that anterior swim bladder inflation relies on increased thyroid hormone levels at this specific developmental time point.
While evidence supports a link between reduced serum T4 levels and reduced anterior swim bladder inflation, experimental evidence suggests that inhibition of T4 synthesis does not result in reduced posterior swim bladder inflation. The absence of effects on posterior chamber inflation is possibly due to maternal transfer of T4 into the eggs. These maternally derived THs are depleted at 21 dpf and cannot offset TPO inhibition, resulting in impaired anterior chamber inflation. This has been previously suggested by Reider and Connaughton (2014) with specific reference to eye development.
Maternal thyroid hormone levels in embryos have been demonstrated in zebrafish, fathead minnow, brown trout, striped bass, tilapia, rabbitfish, conger eel, sea bream and different species of salmon (Walpita et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2012; Power et al., 2001; Brown et al., 1987, 1988).
Alt et al. (2006) found a first differentiated thyroid follicle in zebrafish at 55 hours post fertilization. Elsalini et al. (2003) used immunohistochemistry to show the development of the first thyroid follicles producing thyroid hormone at 72 hours post fertilization in zebrafish. During further larval development, the number of follicles increases. Therefore early developmental processes (before thyroid activation) that are dependent on T4, such as posterior swim bladder inflation, might not be affected by chemicals reducing T4 synthesis. Nelson et al. (2016) and Stinckens et al. (2016) indeed found that MBT (a thyroperoxidase inhibitor) decreased T4 levels in both zebrafish (5 days post fertilization) and fathead minnow (6 days post fertilization), which is after activation of the thyroid gland for both species, while it did not affect posterior inflation. Stinckens et al. (unpublished results) also found that exposure to the thyroperoxidase inhibitor benzophenone-2 did not affect posterior swim bladder inflation.

	dcterms:description	"""Propagation of a leukaemic cell clone is based on both blockage of differentiation to more mature cells and ability to expand in an uncontrolled way. Formation of the MLL-rearranged fusion genes and their protein products are intimately involved in both the blocked differentiation of HSPCs and the expansion of the fusion gene-carrying clone. It is believed that the fusion gene product block cell differentiation by inhibiting the normal transcriptional programs and recruiting repressor molecules such as histone deacetylase enzymes (Greaves 2002; Teitell and Pandolfi 2009). Furthermore, the fusion gene product activates other key target genes, which ultimately lead to the propagation of transformed cell lines without normal restrictions (Greaves 2015; Sanjuan-Pla et al 2015). Therefore, the potential of both differentiation blockage and clonal expansion are inherent properties of the MLL-rearranged fusion product, based on the preservation of some original functions, even if in a modified form, and on the gain of some other functions due to the sequences from the new fusion partner gene (Marschalek 2010; Sanjuan-Pla et al 2015).

Molecular mechanisms

The MLL is the most common translocation gene in infant leukaemia. The N-terminal part of MLL becomes fused in frame to one of a large number of fusion partners, but in most cases, this fusion occurs between the N-terminal MLL and either AF4, AF6, AF9, AF10, or ENL (Krivtsov and Armstrong 2007). Due to the DNA-binding properties of the N-terminal MLL motif, these fusion proteins are always nuclear and bind to target genes controlled by MLL irrespective of the normal location of the C-terminal partner.

Many fusion proteins have been shown to recruit disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L or officially KMT4, a histone methyltransferase that methylates lysine 79 located within the globular domain of histone H3, H3K79) to the promoters of MLL target genes. This recruitment seems to be a common feature of many oncogenic MLL fusion proteins and results in abnormal H3K79 methylation and overexpression of several MLL target genes, such as HOXA genes coding for transcription factors involved in body patterning and hematopoiesis (Chen and Armstrong, 2015).&nbsp;Although DOT1L is not genetically altered in the disease per se, its mislocated enzymatic activity is a direct consequence of the chromosomal translocation. Thus, DOT1L has been proposed to be a catalytic driver of leukemogenesis (Chen and Armstrong 2015). The enzymatic activity of DOT1L is critical to the pathogenesis of MLL, because methyltransferase-deficient Dot1L is capable of suppressing growth of MLL-rearranged cells. A small-molecule inhibitor of DOT1L inhibits cellular H3K79 methylation, blocks leukemogenic gene expression, and selectively kills cultured cells bearing MLL translocations (Chen and Armstrong 2015). One of the target gene of DOT1L is BCL-2, belonging to a family of anti-apoptotic genes, which maintains the survival of the MLL-rearranged cells (Benito et al 2015). Expression of BCL-2 is high in human MLL-AF4 leukemia cells from a large number of patients.&nbsp; A specific BCL-2 inhibitor, ABT-199 is capable of killing MLL-AF4 leukaemia cells and prevents cell proliferation in xenograft mouse leukaemia models (Benito et al 2015). Furthermore, a MLL-AF4 cell line is sensitive to a combination of ABT-199 and DOT1L inhibitors. The figure below&nbsp;provides a schematic representation of the molecular pathway.


&nbsp;

MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblestic leukemisa activate BCL-2 through H3K79 methylation and are sensitive to the BCL-2 specific antagonist ABT-199 (benito et al, Cell Rep 2015).

&nbsp;

Possible facilitating mutated genes

Recurrent activating mutations in the components of the PI3K-RAS signalling pathway have been detected in almost half of the tested MLL-rearranged ALLs in one study (Andersson et al 2015). Prenatal origin of RAS mutations have been demonstrated also in other studies of infant leukaemia with frequencies of about 15-25 % of cases (Driessen et al 2013; Prelle et al 2013; Emerenciano et al 2015).&nbsp; Emerenciano et al (2015) are of the opinion that RAS mutations seem not to be driver mutations, but may aid disease onset by accelerating the initial expansion of cells.

Overall the activation of the RAS pathway could support the extremely rapid progression of the infant leukaemia. Under this view the mechanism may represent a factor modulating (i.e., increasing) the progression and severity of the adverse outcome, rather than a necessary key event (second hit) for infant leukaemia. In the transgenic MLL-AF4 mouse model, activated K-RAS accelerated disease onset with a short latency (Tamai et al 2011), possibly by augmenting the upregulation of HoxA9. In a recent study of Prieto et al (2016),the activated K-RAS&nbsp; enhanced extramedullary haematopoiesis of MLL-AF4 expressing cell lines and cord blood-derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells that was associated with leucocytosis and central nervous system infiltration, both hallmarks of infant MLL-AF4 leukaemia. However, K-RAS activation was insufficient to initiate leukaemia, supporting that the involvement of RAS pathway is an important modifying factor in infant leukemia. It has also been demonstrated that MLL-AF6 fusion product sequesters AF6 into the nucleus to trigger RAS activation in myeloid leukaemia cells and it is possible to attenuate the activation by tipifarnib, a RAS inhibitor (Manara et al 2014).

A possibility that MLL fusions render cells susceptible to additional chromosomal damage upon exposure to etoposide was studied by introducing MLL-AF4 and AF4-MLL via CRISPR/Cas9-genome editing in HEK293 cells as a model to study MLL fusion-mediated DNA-DSB formation/repair (Castano et al 2016). In short, the expression of fusion genes does neither influence DNA signaling nor DNA-DSB repair.

	dcterms:description	"""Certain TopoII poisons stabilize the intermediate cleavage complex and prevent the religation with appropriate DNA strands. Covalently DNA end-bound TopoII protein is digested and a hanging end is created. The same process happens in the translocation partner gene. Hanging ends of both genes are processed and subsequently joined by non-homologous end joining (Cowell and Austin 2012). Indeed, compounds that increase the rate of DNA cleavage and decrease the rate of DNA religation by topo II enzyme are often referred to as Topo II &quot;poisons&quot; (Nitiss 2009).Topoisomerase poisons stabilize the normally transient topoisomerase-induced DSBs and are potent and widely used anticancer drugs (Cowell and Austin 2012). They interfer with the religation step in the topoisomerase II reaction cycle, leading to the accumulation of DNA DSBs. The inhibition of the religation step will result in the formation of an unusual type of DSB called a cleavage complex, in which the topoisomerase protein remains covalently coupled to the DNA (Cowell and Austin 2012).

	dcterms:description	"""There is evidence that the&nbsp;inappropriate joining of &lsquo;hanging ends&rsquo; following DSB happens in the same transcriptional factory (hub), and the result is a fusion gene and ultimately protein product (Cowell &amp; Austin 2012; Pendleton et al 2014; Sanjuan-Pla et al 2015). The first part of this description has not been shown in the putative target cell, which is still not unequivocally identified, but for the second part there is ample evidence of formation of MLL-AF4 fusion product that has been a result of a very early chromosomal translocation and rejoining. It is of interest that the simultaneously induced specific DSBs in the MLL gene and two different translocation partners (AF4 and AF9) by engineered nucleases in human HSPCs resulted in specific &lsquo;patient-like&rsquo; chromosomal translocations (Breese et al 2016).&nbsp;For the scope of this AOP , this KE relationship should occur in-utero.

Transient histone hyperacetylation was sufficient for the activation of p21 (Wu JT). TSA (0.3 mM) induced p21 mRNA expression in 1 hr, whereas the induction is repressed in 24 hrs after stimulation (Wu JT). On the other hand, butyrate and repetitive doses of TSA induced p21 mRNA expression in 24 hrs (Wu JT). Histone hyperacetylating agents butyrate and TSA induced p21 mRNA expression (Archer SY). HDAC1 overexpression blocked the induction of p21 by butyrate and TSA, indicating that the p21 induction is mediated by histone hyperacetylation (Archer SY). SAHA induced the accumulation of acetylated histones in the chromatin of the p21WAF1 gene and this increase was associated with an increase in p21WAF1 expression (Richon VM2000).

P21 interacts directly with cyclins through a conserved region in close to its N-terminus (amino acids 17-24; Cy1) (Dotto, 2000). P21 has second weak cyclin binding domain near its C-terminus region (amino acids 153-159), which overlaps with its PCNA binding domain (Dotto, 2000). Kinase activity of cyclin-Cdk kinase was inhibited by Cy1 site of p21 that is important for the interaction of p21 with cyclin-Cdk complexes (Chen, 1996).

p21 inhibits the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 or cyclin-dependent kinase 4 complexes which regulates cell cycle progression in G1 phase, leading to increased disruption of cell cycle.

	dcterms:description	"""Neurosteroids are steroids synthesized in the brain that interact with cell surface receptors or ligand-gated ion channels in order to modify the neuronal excitability (Paul and Purdy, 1992). They are involved in numerous biological functions including locomotor activity, memory, learning, sexually-dimorphic behaviors and anxiety.

Neurosteroids are synthesized from pregnenolone or its derivatives by different cytochromes P450. Among these CYPs is CYP7B hydroxylase which synthesizes the neurosteroid 7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone. CYP7B is the only enzyme responsible for the synthesis of this neurosteroid. Therefore, its inhibition induces a decrease in 7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone concentration in the brain.

The expression of CYP7B and the synthesis of its molecular product vary cyclically on a daily and/or seasonal basis. In male quail, a diurnal animal, CYP7B expression and 7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone are inhibited by melatonin secretion, a hormone involved in circadian rhythm and sleep regulation. Oppositely, in a nocturnal animal such a newt, melatonin acts as an inducer of CYP7B expression and 7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone synthesis. These results indicate that CYP7B expression and therefore 7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone synthesis follow a circadian rhythm regulation. &nbsp;

In addition to this daily variation, CYP7B and its product are regulated by seasons in salmon and male newt where it peaks during homing migration (salmon) and breeding (newt) period (Haraguchi et al., 2009). It is plausible that the same seasonal variation occurs in avian.

7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone is synthesized by CYP7B in the telencephalon of both male and female. Its concentration fluctuates in the male brain according to season and light exposure, whereas it remains low in female. In agreement with the variation in 7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone concentration is the variation in sexual behavior frequency in male. Indeed, it was previously noted that 7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone peaked during the breeding period, increasing locomotor activity and frequency of tail-vibrating behavior (newt) or chasing, crowing, strutting, and mounting (bird).

Other components are required to induce sexual behavior since injection of 7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone in sexually immature newt has no effect on this specific parameter. However, no sexual behavior can be elicited in absence of 7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone.

The latter is important because the Cyp2E1 catalytic cycle is prone to uncoupling (i.e., instead of incorporating an oxygen atom in to the substrate, the catalytic cycle is interrupted because a superoxide radical is released), which results in the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an increase in cellular oxidative stress (Lieber 1999).

	dcterms:description	"""Oxidative stress leads directly to cytotoxicity through lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation occurs when ROS scavenge electrons from poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including membrane phospholipids. Lipid peroxidation occurs in three steps: initiation (in which the PUFA radical is produced), propagation (in which PUFA radicals react with molecular oxygen and a non-radical molecule to produce a lipid peroxide and lipid radical), and termination (in which two radicals combine to form a non-radical). Left unchecked, the propagation chain reaction is highly damaging to cellular membranes. Lipid peroxidation of mitochondrial membranes has been shown to result in both necrosis and apoptosis. The former occurs due to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential leading to decreased ATP production. The latter is a result of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). The mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is a process that can lead to necrosis or apoptosis. It is an important cell death mechanism because it is sensitive to redox. Accumulation of ROS and depletion of glutathione trigger the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (ASK1--&gt;MKK4--&gt;JNK), which recruits Bax to the outer mitochondrial membrane (Youle and Strasser 2008). Bax triggers the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MTP), through which cytochrome c is released, which triggers the caspase cascade and apoptosis. Alternatively, when the MTP opens across the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, mitochondrial swelling and decoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (i.e., loss of ATP generation) leads to cell death by necrosis (Pessayre, et al. 2010, Rasola and Bernardi 2007).

Oxidative stress triggers cytotoxicity indirectly by modifying redox sensitive cellular molecules. Proteins with neighboring cysteine residues sense ROS through the oxidation of adjacent thiol groups (2SH, reduced; S=S, oxidized). Examples of this include: (1) the cellular anti-oxidant glutathione (GSH), which acts to &lsquo;mop up&rsquo; ROS (GSH oxidized to GS=SG), and its depletion is associated with elevated cytotoxicity; (2) the cellular anti-oxidant thioredoxin, which inhibits the apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (Ask1) in its reduced form, but not in its oxidized form (Liu, et al. 2000, Saitoh, et al. 1998); and, (3) the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which opens when oxidized (Petronilli, et al. 1994). Oxidative stress can also produce cell death through the production of oxidative damage to DNA. &nbsp;Examples of types of oxidative DNA damage include: (Sharma, et al. 2012, Shukla, et al. 2013, Skipper, et al. 2016).

	dcterms:description	"""Hepatocytes are typically quiescent, with only about 1-2% turnover. However, following surgical resection or chemically induced injury, the liver is able to activate cell division and regenerate itself. On a cellular level, the liver has two modes of regeneration: (1) cellular hypertrophy and division of existing cells; (2) dedifferentiation, redifferentiation, and proliferation of a population of facultative stem cells that is located at the Canals of Hering (Stanger 2015).&nbsp;

On a molecular level, how liver regeneration occurs is less completely understood. Molecular signals that are released from dying cells trigger regenerative proliferation of existing cells. Important players include the transcription factors AP-1 (particularly the c-Jun monomer) and NF-kappaB, both of which are not normally expressed in adult liver, but are up-regulated following partial hepatectomy and are required for hepatic regeneration.

Under normal circumstances, these metabolites immediately become conjugated to molecules like glutathione or glucuronic acid, which facilitates their excretion. However, these metabolites can react with off-target cellular molecules, which in extreme cases (e.g., at toxic doses or following glutathione depletion during periods of oxidative stress) cause damage that results in cytotoxicity. Typically, the unmetabolised Cyp2E1 substrates are inert, whereas their metabolites are highly cytotoxic; e.g., furan and its metabolite cis-2-butene-1,4-dial (BDA); ethanol (EtOH) and acetaldehyde; carbon tetrachloride and trichloromethyl radical (which forms the trichloromethyl peroxy radical); and, chloroform and phosgene. Lipid peroxidation in the context of Cyp2E1 has been reviewed (Caro and Cederbaum 2004). Moreover, chronic exposure to Cyp2E1 agonists depletes of conjugating enzymes and &nbsp;diminishes capacity to deal with reactive metabolites in the cell.

	dcterms:description	"""There are a variety of ways in which oxidative stress can lead indirectly to cancer. The main routes involve: (a) reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause cytotoxicity, followed by regenerative proliferation leading to cancer; (b) ROS-induced DNA damage leading to mutations in cancer-driver genes and subsequently cancer; and (c) oncogenic effects of the up-regulation of NRF2. The focus of this iKER is on (b) and (c), as the details of (a) are mapped out elsewhere.

The types of genotoxic oxidative DNA damage that may occur following exposure to ROS have been extensively reviewed previously (Dizdaroglu 2012, Dizdaroglu 2015). Briefly, ROS can react with nitrogenous bases to produce various adducts that may be converted into a mutation following DNA replication. Further, ROS can damage the sugar phosphate backbone of DNA leading to abasic sites and strand breaks. If DNA damage leads to mutations that increases the expression of oncogenes or decreases the expression of tumour suppressor or DNA damage repair genes, they will transform normal cells into malignant cells. It is generally thought that liver cancer results from an accumulation of mutations in key cancer-driving genes such as TP53 and CTNNB1 (Fujimoto, et al. 2016, Shibata and Aburatani 2014a) (http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org/Tumors/HepatoCarcinID5039.html).&nbsp;

In addition to DNA damage, at the molecular level, chronic activation of the Nrf2 oxidative stress response has been linked to promoting malignant transformation in pre-cancerous cells. Persistent Nrf2 activation results in the long-term up-regulation of antioxidant genes (which protect cancer cells that are known to have elevated ROS) and phase II metabolism genes (which facilitate the rapid metabolism of chemotherapeutics) (Kansanen, et al. 2013) providing a favourable environment for growth of pre-cancerous cells. The connection between chronically activated Nrf2 and cancer has been extensively studied and reviewed, most recently by Furfaro et al. (2016) and Karin and Dhar (2016). Further, Nrf2 control over cellular proliferation and differentiation has also been studied; reviewed most recently by Murakami and Motohashi &nbsp;(2015).&nbsp;

	dcterms:description	"""Cytotoxicity caused by necrosis, apoptosis and/or necroptosis leads to regenerative proliferation. However, in addition, cytotoxicity caused by necrosis/necroptosis results in the release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which trigger inflammation (Brenner, et al. 2013, Kaczmarek, et al. 2013, Luedde, et al. 2014). Chronic inflammation is considered to be a risk factor for cancer (although the mechanism is not clear). The inflammatory response is part of the innate immune response and includes vasodilation (causing heat and redness) and increased vasopermeability (causing edema and infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, and plasma proteins). Acute inflammation is a helpful and necessary response to tissue damage or infection; whereas, chronic inflammation exacerbates (and could even cause) a large number of diseases. During chronic inflammation, bouts of healing and cytotoxicity occur simultaneously, typically leading to inflammation-dependent tissue damage, fibrosis, and production of oxidative stress.

Chronic inflammation is responsible for facilitating carcinogenesis in the liver through what is known as the Inflammation-Fibrosis-Cancer (IFC) axis, which is thought to accompany ~90% of hepatocellular carcinoma cases. Liver inflammation is largely mediated by Kupffer cells (resident liver macrophages) that release cytokines that bind hepatocyte plasma membrane receptors to activate intra-cellular signaling cascades. One outcome of this complex signaling is the activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor, which is a master regulator of the IFC axis (Elsharkawy and Mann 2007, Karin 2006, Karin 2009, Luedde and Schwabe 2011). Increased NF-kappaB expression is important for the transition from liver injury and inflammation to tumour promotion and hepatocellular cancer (Pikarsky, et al. 2004, Wang, et al. 2003). However, NF-kappaB is a dimeric, redox sensitive molecule that is controlled through double inhibition (see below) (Vallabhapurapu and Karin 2009). Therefore, its actions are very much context dependent and it has a dynamic range of molecular outcomes and effects. The contradictory nature of NF-kappaB&rsquo;s role in carcinogenesis has been well documented (Finkin and Pikarsky 2011, Pikarsky and Ben-Neriah 2006, Vainer, et al. 2008).

NF-kappaB is a dimeric transcription factor that has at least six potential monomers and is thought to bind regulatory sequences of ~200 target genes. Transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB is controlled through double inhibition: the inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) sequesters NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm. IkappaB, in turn, is inhibited by the IkappaB kinase (IKK). Mdr2-knockout mice spontaneously develop cholestatic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma and therefore represent a good model system for this disease. When NF-kappaB is lost (using a hepatocyte-specific inducible IkappaB-super-repressor transgene) during early stages of the disease, there is no effect on development of hepatitis or malignant transformation; however, blocking NF-kappaB at later stages of the disease (&gt;7 months) results in apoptosis and failure to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (Pikarsky, et al. 2004). NF-kappaB activity and regulation is perplexingly complex. Certainly, it is clear that the context of NF-kappaB activation is crucial to its outcome.

	dcterms:description	"""Every time a cell divides, there is a small chance that a mutation might occur. Because hepatocytes are polyploid, there is an increased rate of error-prone division due to multipolar mitotic spindles, which can result in aneuploidy in daughter cells (Stanger 2015). The risk for mutation is further increased when these cells are under stress (e.g., by a chemical exposure or increased oxidative stress). While it is generally understood that increased cellular proliferation is a predisposing factor to chemical carcinogenesis&mdash; &lsquo;sustained proliferative signaling&rsquo; is one of the Hallmarks of Cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg 2000, Hanahan and Weinberg 2011) and IARC identifies altered cell proliferation as a key characteristic of a carcinogen (Smith, et al. 2015)&mdash;the exact mechanism for how one leads to the other is not altogether clear. There will be many steps in between observations of overt cellular proliferation leading to hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, we describe this as an indirect KER with the hopes that additional empirical data to support the intervening steps will be available in the future, and that these additional KE(R)s can be developed at that time.

These highly unstable free radicals can easily react with macromolecules such as lipids. The brain has a high level of PUFAs and neuronal cells are known to be relatively unable to neutralize free radicals. Together with the knowledge that free radicals mainly attack PUFAs make neuron cells vulnerable for lipid peroxidation. The reaction between free radicals and PUFAs leads to the formation of highly reactive electrophilic aldehydes, such as MDA and HNE.&nbsp; Lipid peroxidation can be described by 5 steps. The initiation of the free radical, production of peroxyl radical, self-perpetuating chain reaction (leading to several by-products), termination by which radicals form stable products and finally termination, where reaction between radicals and antioxidants (vitamin C and E) give rise to non-radical products and unreactive radicals.

There are two main principles of HNE-modification of proteins, the Schiff&rsquo;s Base Formation and the Michael Addition. Schiff&rsquo;s Base Formation is the reaction of the aldehydic group of HNE with an amino group of a protein. Where the Michael Addition is a reaction of the HNE double bond to a protein side chain. HNE has the preference for amino acid modification Cys &agrave; His &agrave; Lys which results in a covalent adduct with the protein nucleophilic side chain.

Another possibility is that key proteins in the ER are altered, which inhibits their function. Ultimately the ER homeostasis will be disturbed, which leads to ER stress and the activation of UPR.

This is a defence mechanism in a cell, which starts with ER stress when there is an overload of ROS. At low level the activation of PERK in the UPR can prevent further oxidative stress. In several neurodegenerative diseases ER stress was reported. The exact mechanism and the link between ROS and UPR is not completely understood.

	dcterms:description	"""&nbsp;Lipid peroxidation can induce apoptosis due to two different toxic effects. First of all lipids are responsible for maintaining the integrity of cellular membranes. Due to peroxidation of the lipids in the cellular membrane they lose their composition, structure and dynamics of lipid membranes. Various functions are lost, there is an increase of membrane rigidity, decrease activity of membrane-bound enzymes and altered permeability. Secondly there is the formation of highly reactive compounds such as lipid peroxides (MDA, HNE). These lipid peroxides can generate more ROS or can crosslink with important proteins in the cell. Several apoptosis pathways are started due to increased levels of ROS and HNE. p53 is induced and phosphorylated by HNE, as well as inducement of death receptor Fas (CD95). Also due to lipid peroxidation an energetic disturbance is reached, since the protein pumps lost their function. This can lead to neuronal cell death. &nbsp;

This is done by the proteins IRE1, PERK and ATF-6 which are released from the ER. The main protein involved in apoptosis is CHOP, which is part of the pathway after activation of the PERK protein. But also IRE1 plays a big role in the cell death regulation.

	dcterms:description	"""The promiscuous nature of the AHR with its ability to bind to a large number of endogenous and exogenous ligands, make the task of constructing an AOP a challenge. For example, many structurally diverse chemicals can bind to and activate the AHR, including dioxin-like chemicals (DLCs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), indole-3-carbinol as found in broccoli and Brussels sprouts, natural flavonoids such as quercetin, galangin and genistein, and endogenous ligands such as indirubicin, equilenin, metabolites of arachidonic acid, heme, tryptophan, and UV photoproducts of tryptophan such as 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) [1] [2] [3] 
It is believed, although not proven, that the endogenous and natural ligands ingested in the diet participate in normal homeostatic control of development and physiology through episodic and short-lived AHR activation. Developmental pathologies in AHR knockout rodents and toxicity associated with sustained AHR activation provide evidence that the AHR has a normal and necessary role. [1] [2] Weak agonists also include benzimidazoles such as omeprazole used pharmaceutically as a proton pump inhibitor and antihelminthics such as thiabendazole. Other weak agonists include primaquine, vinclozolin, YH439, phenylthiourea, curcumin and Oltipraz. [4] Therefore, a necessary task for this AOP is to differentiate between AHR ligands that act as rodent liver tumour promoters and those that do not. It may be that ligands resistant to metabolic clearance (e.g., TCDD), or sufficiently high doses of rapidly cleared ligands are able to create the sustained AHR activation required to bring about tumour promotion.
Chemical properties for a selection of AHR ligands are provided in Table 3 along with EC50, which itself is a measure of potency and one of the determinants of sustained AHR activation. These representative ligands demonstrate the diversity in chemical properties modelling pharmacokinetics and bioavailability as well as sources, including anthropogenic chemicals, dietary constituents, and endogenous substances formed in vivo. The determinants of sustained AHR activation include:


AHR binding potency, usually measured by an EC50 or ED50 value;

AHR binding efficacy or intrinsic activity measured by the maximal response;

pharmacokinetic determinants including,

Speed and extent of metabolism/elimination of a particular ligand;

Delivery to the target tissue; and,



Magnitude and duration of exposure.


Not all AHR ligands will produce sustained activation. Some ligands may stabilize the AHR, thus keeping it activated for longer times. [5] DLCs are highly hydrophobic and lipid soluble with half-lives in humans up to seven years or more. [6] Hence, a single high-dose exposure to a highly persistent compound such as TCDD can lead to sustained AHR activation sufficient to trigger some of the early responses. [7] In rodents, some of these high-dose responses may lead to the occurrence of KEs. [8] Exposure to lower doses over a long time may also produce sustained activation but may not culminate in increased tumour incidence. [9] Endogenous ligands have very different chemical characteristics than halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, and dioxin-like PCBs. The endogenous ligand FICZ is a more potent AHR agonist than TCDD but is rapidly metabolized by CYP1A1 in a negative feedback loop. As noted, control of AHR activation by endogenous ligands probably plays a role in development. [3]  [10]  [11]

Ideally, a table similar to Table 3 could be assembled with data on a range of diverse chemicals with results from common assays providing measures of potency, efficacy and metabolism. This information set may be of some utility in predicting the likelihood of a particular chemical to produce sustained AHR activation (the MIE). However, the use of structural alerts or QSAR considerations to predict the occurrence of the MIE remains an area of interest and may become more feasible in the future.

Lung injury and lung fibrosis are the major adverse effects of this drug in humans (Hay J et al., 1991). Bleomycin is shown to induce lung fibrosis in experimental animals - in dogs (Fleischman RW et al., 1971), mice (Adamson IY and Bowden DH, 1974), hamsters (Snider GL et al., 1978) and is widely used as a model to study the mechanisms of fibrosis (reviewed in Moeller A et al., 2008; Gilhodes J-C et al., 2017).
